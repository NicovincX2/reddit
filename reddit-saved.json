        "content": "As someone in the industry, I admit that I approached this article with a fair amount of skepticism as I've seen many similar articles in the past make dubious claims of where to get started, or just flat out suggesting pursuit of non-relevant certifications or throwing you into the deep end without checking to see if you can even \"swim\" first. However, I can safely say that this is a really good article and I highly recommend it. I'd only make a few nitpicks and additional comments:\n\n1.) Networking. Seriously. This needs to be footstomped and yelled out to the high holy heavens. Please, please, please understand Networking if you want to get into pen testing. Understand the OSI model, understand what ports are, understand what terms like SYN-ACK mean. Pen testers live and breathe Nmap/Zenmap, or at least I do on a regular basis when looking for an initial foothold that is within scope, assuming we're not being handed one to emulate an adversary already on the network. Something else to understand is how an enterprise network is laid out. Lateral movement is a big deal when pen testing, so you're going to need to understand enterprise network architecture to \"pivot\" and move around.\n\n2.) SANS. The return on investment is low, and while I would say that I prefer my OSCP over my GPEN (as do a few employers now), the amount of material that SANS gives you for the GPEN is incredible, the labs are good, and the instructors are all well known in the field as well. That being said, only pursue the GPEN if your employer is willing to pay for it. The class and certification is a solid 8 grand otherwise. The OSCP is about $1.2k for certification attempt and 90 days to study with their resources, and yes, you will want the 90 day option. 60 if you have some experience in the field. Absolutely do not take the 30 day option if you're new to pen testing at all. That's just rushing yourself and setting yourself up for failure.\n\n3.) Coding. Thank you for echoing something I've been trying to say for awhile. Being able to read code is the requirement. Exploit development is honestly a different trade/profession from pen testing in my experience, because security firms for pen tests are just going to have you running things like SimplyEmail, Metasploit, Hydra, Nmap/Zenmap, BurpSuite, Nikto, and other vetted and tested tools. You will RARELY, if ever (I've only had it happen once), where a client authorizes 0-days as within scope. This is because 0-days should work by virtue of them being, well, 0-days. Additionally, if you were to hypothetically employ a 0-day that you discovered, there's no telling what sort of risk that can make you liable for as a pen tester, which is specifically why firms don't let you use them.\n\nEdit: I honestly have a Number 4, and I think this is something that anyone outside looking in needs to understand about \"hacking\" before pursuing it. The first part is that hacking is fun if you enjoy a good puzzle and challenge. A lot of environments that you'll test in are different, but are similar in a lot of ways, so you may end up seeing the same thing again and again. This can often be pretty demoralizing when you realize that your clients are handling sensitive information or worse. Additionally, hacking as you see in \"Hollywood\" is not as fast or glamorous. Mr. Robot is the only show that I've seen that comes close to actual hacking and even the show took some creative liberty to make things go by quicker. Otherwise, it's a lot of running scripts and waiting for results. Lastly, do not get into this profession expecting to be the next Elliot Alderson or donning an Anonymous mask or what have you. There is a lot of cringing that happens in this field when people bring up Anonymous and that kind of thing. Being a pen tester means you have the magical word to do what you do: Consent. Your contracts, your defined scope, and the magical piece of paper that gives you permission is what saves you from being thrown in a jail cell. If people cannot trust you, you will not last in this field and the field is small enough to where a bad reputation can and will get you blacklisted from major security firms that hire for these positions. Please be smart.\n\nAnyway. Solid article. I've bookmarked it myself for others who've thrown the same question at me."

        "content": "Evangelical Republicans are exactly the pharisees Jesus railed against in the Bible they claim is the divine word of God. Feel free to pick one you like:\n\n- ”You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God so you can observe your own traditions!” **Mark 7:9**\n\n- \"Why do you call me \"Lord! Lord!\" when you do not do as I say?\" **Luke 6:46**\n\n- “Woe to you, teachers of the law, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.“ **Luke 11:46**\n\n- \"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' fortunes and make a show of reciting prayers. Theirs will be the greater condemnation.” **Luke 20: 46-47**\n\n- ”Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.” **Matthew 7:15**\n\n- \"Not everyone who calls me Lord will enter God’s kingdom, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven. On the Last Day many will call me Lord. They will say, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not testify in your name? And did we not, in your name, exorcise demons and perform many miracles?' Truly I will say to them, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you evildoers.’\" **Matthew 7:21-23**\n\n- \"Hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship is false, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men.\" **Matthew 15:7-9**\n\n- “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You would cross land and sea to win a single convert, only to make them twice the child of Hell as yourselves.” **Matthew 23:15**\n\n- “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You could have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.\" **Matthew 23:23**\n\n- “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but inside contain the bones of the dead and the unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous, but inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\" **Matthew 23:27-28**\n\nThe rest of the Bible also wouldn't be too keen on them:\n\n- Day after day they seek me and take delight in knowing my way, as if they were a righteous people who did not forsake the justice of God; they invoke righteous judgments; they boast of their closeness to God. “Why have we fasted, and you did not see us? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you ignore us?” Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, while you oppress the workers. You fast with anger and to quarrel, to strike others harshly with your fists. Fasting like yours these days will not make your voice heard on high. **Isaiah 58:2-4**\n\n- Woe to you who long for the Day of the Lord! Why do you long for the Day of the Lord? That Day will be darkness, not light. It will be as though a man fled from a lion, only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall, only to have a snake bite him. **Amos 5:18-19**\n- “I hate, I despise your feasts, and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Though you offer me your grain and burnt offerings, I will not accept them; and the peace offerings of your fattened animals, I will not look upon. Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody of your harps I will not listen. But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” **Amos 5:21-27**\n\n- “Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations? **Jeremiah 7:8-10**\n\n- “As for you, Son of Man, your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, saying to each other, ‘Come and hear the message of the Lord.’ They come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to hear your words, but they do not practice them. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain. Indeed, to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear what you say, but will not do it. **Ezekiel 33:31-32**\n\n- Its leaders give judgment for bribes; its priests teach for a price; its prophets practice divination for money; yet they lean on the Lord and say, “Is the Lord not among us? We are under his protection.’” **Micah 3:11**\n\n- They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work. **Titus 1:16**\n\n- May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! **Acts 8:20**\n\n- Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. **James 1:22-24**\n\n- Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. **James 1:26**\n\n- Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. **James 3:1**\n\n- Whoever says “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did. **1 John 2:3-6**\n\n- “If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.” **1 Timothy 6:3-5**\n\n- ”For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.\" **2 Timothy 4: 3-4**\n\n- For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds. **2 Corinthians 11:13-15**"

        "content": "EDIT: [Follow this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/kmodia/improved_text_video_tutorial_on_how_to_rip_from/)\n\n~~I'm going to explain this process in other words, including images and videos. This assumes you have already installed the Widevine L3 Decryptor.~~\n\n~~Step 1: Find a TV show or movie you want to download and open the inspect element before clicking on it.~~\n\n~~Step 2: Start streaming the video with the inspect element open. Preferably, you should be preserving all network logs (~~[~~you can find it here, in the settings~~](https://imgbox.com/YXx8Eis0)~~)~~\n\n~~Step 3: In the network tab, search for \"mpd\" (should look something like~~ [~~this~~](https://imgbox.com/WszKGkbL)~~). Right click on one of them, and copy the response (~~[~~image~~](https://imgbox.com/e5x49lIw)~~). Paste this into something like notepad++.~~\n\n~~Step 4: Search for \"cenc:default\\_KID=\". For EACH(!!) result, copy what is inside the quotation marks and paste it somewhere at the top of your document. I recommend first prettifying the xml/html so it is easier to read.~~\n\n~~Video of me doing steps 3 and 4:~~ [~~https://streamable.com/mrmp2m~~](https://streamable.com/mrmp2m)\n\n~~(Remove the dashes in the KID or the decompression will not work.)~~\n\n~~Step 5: Go to the console tab, and find each key that matches a KID you found in the MPD.~~\n\n~~In the video, I found CF1F98F85CB74D9B8A7D5576D126FFDB and 743FB7D3CDE3424B932EE841983F3A20, so I would look for those and then copy the keys from a saved .log file.~~\n\n[~~Video~~](https://streamable.com/p7m6n9)\n\n~~Step 6: Now that you have a key and KID (in my case I had 2 pairs) find your video and audio by searching for it. I want to find the highest quality for each, so I will increment until I dont get a response.~~\n\n[~~Video~~](https://streamable.com/ri0kzb) ~~(only shows audio download \\[with incrementing\\], video is the same process but just search for the video instead of audio)~~\n\n~~Step 6: Now that you have downloaded both encrypted files, in powershell or command prompt type (path to mp4decrypt.exe) --key (KID):(KEY) \"sourcefile.mp4\" \"sourcevideo.mp4\". Consider adding mp4decrypt to PATH. Repeat this process with different KIDs and keys (dont mix and match the keys!) if the conversion did not successfully decrypt the file. (You might be able to use the same KID and key for both files)~~\n\n~~Step 7: Combine them in any way you would like. OP and I would suggest mkvToolnix.~~\n\n~~(It is 2:30 am at the time of writing this, please reply with something I missed or an image / video I should add.)~~"

        "content": "In a sense, we do - that's what many recreational drugs essentially are (they're not supplements, exactly, but they either stimulate the same receptors or cause your body to produce more of the things that do).\n\nBut there are a few problems with it, as that intro should suggest.\n\nFirst, over-release of neurotransmitters causes the body to compensate. It becomes less sensitive to that release, and this can make it impossible to feel their positive effects without help and can cause even the outside help to just get you back to baseline. This is part of why addiction escalates: the first use or two produces powerful euphoria before those mechanisms kick in, but addicts need more and more over time - and meanwhile feel steadily worse than their original baseline in between uses.\n\nMoreover, many of these chemicals have secondary effects. They're not so simple as \"have dopamine -> be happy\". Serotonin, for example, plays essential roles in the digestive system, and overdoses of serotonin [cause a serious medical condition that can straight up kill you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) (it's an important side effect of serotonergic drugs like many antidepressants). This compounds with the previous bullet, and is why drug addiction has numerous physical side-effects, too.\n\nEDIT: As others correctly note, this isn't quite the same thing as direct supplementation (which doesn't work for the simpler reason that most neurotransmitters don't cross the blood-brain barrier, so they'd have no way to get to your brain). There are supplements that do cross it that either are converted to neurotransmitters on the other side or stimulate production, and they do work to increase levels of that transmitter.\n\nEDIT2: Hey, front page folks, ELI5 is explicitly **not** for actual 5-year-olds.

        "content": "Answer:\n\nOkay, honestly, none of the answers I see here are fully correct.\n\nFirst: Democrats have been pushing for $1200 or higher checks since May. The House passed a bill for $3.4T that included larger stimulus checks and unemployment payouts, as well as considerable funding for state and local programs. Republicans immediately called the state and local stuff 'pork', despite it being used to fund things like SNAP food benefits and social programs. All they had to do was claim it went to 'poorly funded blue state cities' and that was all that was needed for their base to follow along.\n\nNext: Mitch McConnell has been the sole issue for a very, very long time. The $3.4T bill is still sitting on his desk, and has not even been brought to a vote, which, as senate majority leader, is actually his job. He penned a $500B 'skinny stimulus' instead in September, which included zero money for state and local governments, a liability shield to protect corporations from workers that get sick from COVID, and a whole lot of nothing as far as direct payments to the people.\n\nMitch's bill failed, filibustered by the Democrats in the senate. Pelosi then passed a second, smaller bill after several months of negotiations, this one totaling $2.2T. The same result: Still sitting on Mitch's desk, collecting dust.\n\nNow, keep in mind, while all of this was happening, the negotiations continued. Trump publicly called for larger stimulus checks, yes, but here's the rub: The president isn't a legislator. The Treasury Secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, who was negotiating with Pelosi, is also not a legislator. The only reason Pelosi was actually negotiating with him is because McConnell refused to come to the table - Mnuchin was literally the only avenue she had to get any kind of possible deal worked out with the GOP.\n\nAt some point, Trump/Mnuchin made a call for a $1.8T stimulus compromise. The compromise was never released to the public so there's no way to know what was in it, but it stil contained the liability shield. It also contained wording that made it possible for Trump to have total control over a very large percentage of the money it suggested for several programs. Both of which were obviously unacceptable to the Democrats. However, before Pelosi and House Democrats said a word, there were already rumblings from Senate GOP that they were not happy with the 'compromise', mostly because of the dollar amount and the 'blue state bailouts'.\n\nMcConnell panned the bill not long after, stating he'd be unable to get Senate GOP on board for a bill of that size. Two days later, he reintroduced his same $500B skinny stimulus bill for a vote, and again it was shot down. This was in mid-October.\n\nFlash forward to after the election, and stimulus talks resume. The GOP is refusing to go over $1T at all, still, and Mitch reintroduced his 'skinny stimulus' for a THIRD vote, which, of course, failed again. At this point, Mnuchin had about $450B left from the CARES act that had not been used for the program it was intended for - that was reappropriated to the new stimulus deal. So, in reality, this $900B stimulus bill is still McConnell's 'skinny stimulus', but without the liability shield it originally contained and with the reappropriated money basically funding all of the UI/Stimulus checks. Democrats, at this point, had to cave on their demands for something larger and comprehensive - it'd been 8 months, and something was better than nothing. There was the kerfuffle about state and local initially, and eventually it and the liability shield got dropped entirely.\n\nThe bill passed the House and Senate, but was coupled with the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2021, as we have almost no time left to pass a spending bill for next year before shit hits the fan. Everyone seemed to be in agreement, though unhappy, and Democrats have been saying they want this to be a band-aid, with another Stimulus coming soon after Biden is inaugurated. It remains to be seen if that will be possible, especially with the fate of the senate still unknown.\n\nAnd then along comes Trump. He popped up on Twitter at the eleventh hour to pan the stimulus bill, claiming it gave undocumented immigrants $1800 and was filled with foreign spending he found unacceptable, and stated that he wanted larger stimulus checks AND for the excess spending to be removed.\n\nThat 'and' is important, and what the GOP is focusing on over checks, because 'fiscal responsibility' during a pandemic, sure. Also, there's a few things I need to explain:\n\nUndocumented immigrants do not receive ANY stimulus. Their family members with valid social security numbers, as they are legal US citizens, are able to receive the total $1800 - which is the initial $1200 stimulus check they were NOT eligible for earlier this year, plus the $600 stimulus check in this new bill.\n\nSecondly, the 'foreign spending' and 'pork' is actually ENTIRELY in the FY2021 White House budget plan: I actually spent a couple of hours reading through the budget and collating each piece of contested spending [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stimuluscheck/comments/kj90ir/my_brain_hurts/) if you'd like proof. Trump, Mnuchin, Lindsey Graham, and several GOP members actually worked together to write this budget plan, which was released to the public in February 2020. Not only that, Trump would have been keyed in to every bit of spending in the current omnibus bill by his administration, as is necessary for any yearly spending bill.\n\nAnd so we came to yesterday: Pelosi and the Democrats put the $2000 checks up as a standalone bill to be voted on by unanimous consent because the House was basically a skeleton crew yesterday, and the only way to possibly pass it was by UC. McCarthy rejected it. He then put the removal of foreign spending up for, again, UC, which was blocked by Pelosi.\n\nNow the $2000 checks need to be deliberated and fully voted on once everyone is back in DC, because the UC vote failed. That will be done next Monday, I believe. It likely will pass the house and die on McConnell's desk.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of millions of people lose their unemployment benefits on Saturday of this week, and Trump has the ability to 'pocket veto' the already-passed stimulus bill, which basically means there is absolutely no way for Congress to override him if he decides to just sit on the bill until January 3rd.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the awards, but please don't spend money you can't afford to. It's Christmas and money's probably tight for everyone here. Happy Holdays! ♥"

        "content": "*Update* Thank you for all the comments below. I've tried to include as many tips and fail safes you have mentioned, in this post. I do recommend people read the comments as I may have missed some.\n\nFirstly, thank you to this excellent community my PC is now built and working (pics to come in another post). I thought here are some lessons I learnt in building the PC, researching and other bits I thought would be worth sharing, as a lot of this I never had even heard about. Some will be obvious and others less so. I should note, that I'm not a pro or someone who does this regularly, just someone who spent a while reading around, so feel free to correct/highlight any mistakes, and I'll try to update the post. The descriptions, aren't really meant to be a full lesson about each part and will be lacking a lot of detail, but are more a jumping board for further reading if anyone is interested. For full information on building a PC I highly recommend looking around on YouTube and other sources.\n\nIf I get anything wrong, please correct me and I'll update.\n\nOn Monitors:\n\n1. If you are after 144Hz 1440p gaming, use a Display Port (DP) cable, not a HDMI, if you can. As you could be hampering your refresh rate, ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming))\n*Update* Although you could be fine if you are using HDMI 2.1, see link for more details \n2. Freesync vs Gsync. For simplicity, both these technologies aim to match performance on screen with your GPU. Freesync works with Radeon, GSync with NVidia (although some Freesync monitors will be GSync compatible, likewise for the otherway around). It's complicated and due to changes in the standards over the years it can vary from monitor to monitor. Make sure to do research on the specific monitor you're wanting to get/have. If you are buying a new monitor keep this in mind. [https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained)\n*Update*According to comments freesync monitors will almost always work with Nvidia. As always, do read around about it.\n3. Windows by default is set to have a refresh rate of 60Hz, if you have a higher spec monitor you can change this to match your monitor in \"Advanced Display settings\".\n\nRAM (All except point 1 was completely new to me)\n\n1. 2 Sticks of 8GB Ram will perform better than 1 stick of 16GB Ram ([https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/](https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/)). Also when installing them, put them in the correct channels, check your Motherboard for details.\n2. Your motherboard will prefer your dual channel RAM to be in specific slots. I had an issue where I couldn't get the maximum performance of my RAM which I had placed in slots 1 and 3, but the moment I put them in 2 and 4 it worked perfectly. Check your motherboard manual.\n3. Enable XMP in Bios (This might also be called DOCP or A-XMP). This will vary between motherboards, but if you don't your 3200MHz ram is likely running a lot slower. In my build, XMP wouldn't work till I put the RAM in the correct channels, hope this saves someone the hours I spent finding this out ;) *Update* You can use Task manager to verify you have done this correctly.\n3b. Someone pointed this out XMP may void your CPU's processor (https://community.amd.com/t5/processors/xmp-profile-ram-3200-mhz-and-amd-warranty-policy-for-ryzen/td-p/145798) (https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/XMP-Warranty-void/td-p/1196241). If anyone knows any more, please message me directly so I can add the details. This was mentioned by someone in the comments and I would rather pass the information and ask you to do your own checking as well.\n4. When picking RAM, frequency matters, but so does CAS Latency. You want high frequency but low CAS (CL) latency. I'd recommend doing more reading about it, if you want to know more I'd recommend doing some more reading, but the \"true latency\" can be calculated as TL = CL \\* 2000/Freq. E.g. CL 18 3600Mhz Ram has a TL of 10ns.\n*Update* Someone who actually knows what they are talking about found point (4) confusing if not perhaps misguided and I recommend you read their post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtdudd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n5. Ensure the speed of the RAM is compatible with the board you are looking to purchase (or visa versa).\n6. Motherboards will have Qualified Vendor Lists, listing RAM they have tested and certified to work. This may be worth looking at. Just because your RAM isn't on the list doesn't mean it won't work, or won't overclock, it just means it hasn't been certified to, so do take this into consideration. (I found this in my build, while it was from Crucial and some Crucial RAM was on the QVL, mine wasn't. Thankfully it was fine.)\n\nMotherboards\n\n1. Newer processors (e.g. at time of writing many AMD motherboards require a bios update for the 5000 series AMD CPU) may require you to install a new BIOS before they can be detected. Not all motherboards can have their bios updated without a CPU installed.  When shopping for your motherboard looking to see if it does USB Bios flashback should be considered. This was completely new to me and glad I learnt it in time.\\*Addition\\* Newer motherboards don't require bios updates and so won't need this feature, though you will have to check.\n2. Different mother boards are compatible with different CPUs, pick your CPU first\n3. CPU coolers may need different mountings depending on the CPU. When picking your cooler keep this in mind, you may need to ensure there is an adaptor.\n*Additions from the comments*\n4. Not all mother boards have connectors for front IO USB-C. If this is important to you and part of your case, it's worth looking into.\n5. Using an M.2 usually disables some of your SATA ports. If you are planning on using all your SATA ports, make sure to check to see if this happens and how it happens on your chosen mother board.\n6. Some motherboards are built with Debug LEDs now that will help you diagnose problems.\n7. If you are after RGB effects, ensure your motherboard is compatible with the effects you want to add. There are 5V and 12V headers, so make sure they match. I'd recommend looking into this more yourself, as I've likely vastly oversimplified. (https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?110272-What-do-5v-and-12v-RGB-cables-look-like-you-ask#:%7E:text=You%20can%20also%20see%20the,as%20shown%20on%20these%20photos)\n\nCPU\n\n1. Some CPU's have integrated graphics. If you don't want to buy a dedicated graphics card, you need to purchase one of these CPU's. You then plug your monitor into the motherboard.\n2. CPU's have a Thermal Design Power, if you are not using the stock cooler read up on it (https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/tdp-thermal-design-power-definition,5764.html)\n\nComponent compatibility\n\n1. Make sure all your components are compatible. PC Part Picker ([https://pcpartpicker.com/](https://pcpartpicker.com/)) is generally pretty good at this. If uncertain, this is a wonderful community to ask.\n\nPower supply\n\n1. PC Part Picker gives you a good idea as to how much power your system will need, if not check the graphics card you intend to buy. Not all machines need a 1000W behemoth. Picking the right one will save you money\n2. Power supplies come with a rating standard e.g. Bronze+ etc..., this is basically their efficiency. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean,36721.html](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean,36721.html)). I think it's safe to suggest people should at least go for Bronze.\n3. Make sure your PSU fits in your case. I bought an ATX PSU, then decided on the 011 Dynamic Mini case, only realise it needed a SFX (smaller) PSU. I ended up going for a different case. Likewise an SFX PSU may not have the cable length you need or fit as snuggly in an ATX case (source: comments section)\n4. Look into the build quality of the PSU. A faulty PSU can cause serious issues down the line, so it is worth taking time look at PSU Tier lists and review. (Link provided by several commenters https://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/)\n\nTools (OP Note: I've only tried Ninite)\n\n1. Ninite ([https://ninite.com/](https://ninite.com/)) Is an easy way to download all the basic programs one tends to install onto a fresh Windows install, without having to go to 10-15 websites. E.g. you can select to install Chrome, Zoom, Steam, OpenOffice all from one installer. If you keep the install, it can also be re-run to update all the software in one swoop.\n2. Patch My PC (https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/patch_my_pc.html) Patches software on your PC (Thank you to the sys admin in the comments for this.)\n3. Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) A powerful command line way to install and upgrade software.\n\n\nStorage\n\n1. M2 drives can be SATA or NVMe, NVMe is faster. (M2 drives are generally plugged directly into the mother board, for anyone who until recently was using a hard disk drive and considered SSDs \"fancy\")\n2. I highly recommend reading this comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtn00w/?context=3) as it contains stuff I was unaware of.\n\nCase\n\n1. If your case has bottom intake or exhaust vents, don't put it directly on carpet, as it can block the air flow.  (Yup....I did need to be told this \\^\\_\\^, my previous computer just didn't have any bottom intake, hell it hardly had any intake).\n2. Make sure your mother board, PSU, GPU and all your components fit in the case. This is particularly worth noting if you are going for a micro ATX or a ITX case. Worth noting is to remember to include fans + GPU length, any additional length caused by radiators (if you water cool), the size of your CPU cooler (if you air cool)\n*Additions from the comments*\n3. When considering your case, if you are water cooling, \"Room for 2x 140mm fans does not always mean room for a radiator as well\". Make sure to double check the clearance. Measure twice buy once. \n\nAdvice on building (Notes and horror stories from the comments)\n1. Many new coolers come with pre-applied thermal paste. If yours doesn't don't forget to apply it, to the CPU (See videos by people with more experience/knowledge than me on what to do).\n2. Remember your mother board I/O shield (advice from the comments about making sure to put it in before you install the motherboard, mine came with it attached).\n3. Make sure the CPU is correctly installed before you clasp it down.\n4. If your motherboard has two slots to install a GPU. One of them (normally the top) will provide better performance. Make sure to use the correct one.\n5. Make sure your CPU cooler doesn't block a RAM slot. In making my PC the AMD wraith has a notch on one side with the AMD logo, thankfully I put the RAM in first, so I swiftly learnt that I had to rotate the cooler 180 degrees to get it to fit.\n6. If you can avoid it, do not build your computer on carpet (and do not stand on carpet when building) and be aware of static when building. If this is your first build, do some reading around this. Wear a static bracelet and attach it to something grounded.\n7. Remember if you have a dedicated graphics card. Plug your monitor into the graphics card, not the motherboard.\n8. If you are installing fans, make sure they are in the correct direction.\n9. When playing the radiator of your AIO (if you are using one) make sure part of it is higher than the pump (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGomv195sk)\n10. It's often worth the time to read the motherboard manual.\n11. This may sound silly, but cables and the sockets on the PSU are often labelled. Be aware of this, it will help you in the build.\n\nMore subjective advice\n\n1. I've been recommend by numerous people to go for Gold+ PSUs, with often being stated that while its more efficient, it will also be better made. Your budget may dictate otherwise. If you look through the comments you will frequently find the advice \"don't cheap out on the PSU and go for at least Gold\"\n2. For most users if your CPU comes with a stock cooler. It will be good enough. You can always change it later. If your planning to overclock, you likely know more than me, so feel free to ignore. *Update* According to the comments, AMD stock coolers tend to be considered good enough, Intel, not so much.\n3. A LOT of people below have said \"Do not mix cables from different PSU manufacturers.\" as they are not universal. I don't know anything about this, so do some additional reading if you are considering doing so. *Update* From further comments this is something to take serious. *Update* from further comments, the word of advice is \"Do your research before using cables not supplied with the PSU you are using.\"\n\nFurther notes from the comments: Below are points I've read in the comments that might be worth drawing to people attention. Please read around the topic if it applies to you.\n1. One person has said XMP causes their Oculus Rift to do weird things.\n\nHope this helps some people. \n*Addition* I recommend reading the comments, as many people have put in their own tips/horror stories ;)\n\nTake care all and Merry Christmas."

        "content": "**tl;dr** Its a good bundle, Wiley is a pretty repuable publisher with some highly recommended books.\n\nSome specific thoughts...\n\n----\n\n**Shellcoder's Handbook** - And oldie but a goodie. Its from a similar time-period as Hacking: Art of Exploitation but unlike AoE it gets much further into exploit dev. The trade-off for the increased depth is that its a less gentle introduction. If I were to recommend an old book, it would be this one. AoE is a nicer introduction, but this one contains more valuable information. Though there is a lot of dated information too. It also has a good section on discovery which again while things have definitely progressed since the 00s its still relevant to consider.\n\n**Practical Reverse Engineering** - My favorite RE book to recommend after Secrets of Reverse Engineering. I like this book because it touches on what it relevant these days, you get some content about both 32bit and 64bit x86, some ARM, some windows kernel stuff, some obfuscation content. And there are exercises for you to work through. I do seem to recall that there are some points where it feel a bit like the \"draw the rest of the owl\" meme but its a concise book that is well done imo.\n\n**Malware Analyst Cookbook** - This is a classic recommendation for malware RE, its dated but it covers a lot of methodology and process stuff which is still relevant. The specific tooling and commands might change but the core concepts haven't. I haven't reviewed this book indepth myself but I've heard good things about it.\n\n**Unauthorized Access** - The book for physical penetration testing. The software/technical content is a bit old (references Backtrack 3 in teh Wifi section). But if you want some insight into the methodology behind performing and more importantly planning a physical pentest, this is a good book for that content, though it also gets into some older hacking hardware and software, some stories, and some social engineering.\n\n**Cryptography Engineering**, **Applied Cryptograph** - Both of these books were highly recommended around the time of their publishing, Cryptography engineering being the more recent book and the one that is still actively recommended in crypto circles. I don't really feel qualified to review either book because these books go far beyond what I've needed to do as a security professional looking at crypto. They are both very much \"engineering\" books; deep and dense covering theory of actually designing and thinking critically about cryptographic systems. Bruce Schneier was an author on both of them. \n\n**Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking** - So if you've ever looks for a Social Engineering book the last version of this book has almost certainly come up _Social Engineering: The **art** of Human Hacking_. This is the 2018 update to that book. I can't think of any other book on social engineering that has been as widely praised. So its a solid book, the technical contents have been updated but even if this were the older book, so much of the theory remains somewhat timeless its a good read regardless.\n\n**Web Application Hackers Handbook** - Excellent book, its age is definitely showing, mostly in the lack of covering certain topics. Dafydd \"portswigger\" Stuttard one of the authors of the book is also the author of BURP Suite so the book heavily utilizes BURP. This was literally required reading at a past job of mine. While its old, so many of the issues remain in web-applications today. That said, rather than updating the book Portswigger has opted to release a free online academy which they keep updated with new attacks https://portswigger.net/web-security which is in some ways a better resource. Its more up to date, but this book is more comprehensive."

        "content": "I'll give you an honest answer: it's meant in good faith, but it's hard to answer something like \"why do people always insult me and people like me?\" without *risking* coming across as insulting...so bear that in mind. \n\nThe tl;dr here is that when you simultaneously claim to have the kinds of complaints you have--small town rotting away, etc.--while also claiming to be right-leaning, you basically come across as either (a) disingenuous, (b) hypocritical , or (c) lacking insight...and neither (a), nor (b), nor (c) is a good look, really.\n\nThe reason you come across that way is because the right--generally on the side of individual responsibility and free-market, yadda-yadda--already has answers for you: \n\n> It's not the government's place to pick winners and losers--that's what the free market is for! The opportunities are drying up in your town because the free market has found better opportunities elsewhere. Moreover, take some personal responsibility! No one forced you to stay there and watch your town rot away--you, yourself, are the one who freely chose to do that, no? Why *didn't* you take some responsibility for yourself, precisely? Moreover--and more importantly--if your town is that important to you, why didn't you take responsibility *for your town*? Did you try to start a business to increase local prosperity? Did you get involved in town governance and go soliciting outside investment? Or did you simply keep waiting for someone else to fix things?\n\nThese aren't necessarily nice things to tell you--I get that--but nevertheless they *are* the answers the principles of the right lead to if you actually apply them to you and your situation, no?\n\nThus why you risk coming across poorly: perhaps you are being (a)--disingenuous--and you don't actually believe what you claim to believe, but find it rhetorically useful? Perhaps you are being (b)--hypocritical--and you believe what you claim to believe, *but only for other people, not yourself*? Or perhaps you are simply (c)--uninsightful--and don't even understand the things you claim to believe well enough to apply them in your own situation?\n\nIn general if someone thinks you're either (a), (b), or (c)--whether consciously or not--they're going to take a negative outlook to you: seeing you as disingenuous or hypocritical means seeing you as participating in a discussion in bad faith, whereas seeing you as simply lacking insight means seeing you as someone running their mouth.\n\nIn practice I think a lot of people see this and get very frustrated--at least subconsciously--because your complaints make you come across as more left-leaning economically than you may realize...but--at least often--people like you still self-identify as right-leaning for cultural reasons. So you also get a bit of a \"we should be political allies...but we can't, b/c you value your cultural identity more than your economics (and in fact don't even seem to apply your own economic ideas to yourself)\".\n\nA related issue is due to the *fact* that, overall, rural, low-density areas are already significantly over-represented at all levels of government--this is obvious at the federal level, and it's also generally-true within each state (in terms of the state-level reps and so on).\n\nYou may still feel as if \"government has forgotten you\"--I can understand and sympathize with the position--but *if* government has forgotten you, whose fault is that? Your general demographic has had outsized representation for longer than you, personally, have been alive--and the trend is actually going increasingly in your general demographic's direction due to aggressive state-level gerrymandering efforts, etc.--and so once again: if you--the collective \"you\", that is--have been \"forgotten\" it's no one's fault but yours--the collective \"yours\"!\n\nThis, too, leads to a certain natural condescension: if you have been overrepresented forever and can't prevent being \"forgotten by government\", the likeliest situation is simply that the collective \"you\" is simply incompetent--unable to use even outsized, disproportionate representation to achieve their own goals, whether due to asking for impossible things or being unwise in deciding how to vote.\n\nThis point can become a particular source of rancor due to the way that that overrepresentation pans out: the rural overrepresentation means that anything the left wants already faces an uphill climb--it has to overcome the \"rural veto\"!--and I think you can understand why that would be frustrating: \"it's always the over-represented rural areas voting against what we want only to turn around and complain about how they feel ignored by government\"...you're not ignored--at all!--it's just that your aggregate actions reveal your aggregate priorities are maybe not what you, individually, think they are.\n\nI think that's enough: continually complaining in ways that are inconsistent with professed beliefs combined with continually claiming about being unable to get government to do what you want despite being substantially over-represented?\n\nNot a good look.\n\n> What am I supposed to do?\n\nOverall I'd say if you really care about your town you should take more responsibility for it. If you aren't involved in your city council or county government yet, why aren't you? You can run for office, of course, or you can just research the situation for yourself.\n\nDo you understand your town and county finances--the operating and maintenance costs of its infrastructure and the sources of revenue (tax base, etc)? Do you have a working understanding of what potential employers consider when evaluating a location to build a factory (etc.), or are you just assuming you do?\n\nIf your town has tried and failed to lure outside investment, have you tried to find out why it failed--e.g. \"what would it have taken to make us the winner?\"--or are you, again, assuming you understand?\n\nI would focus on that--you can't guarantee anything will actually lead to getting the respect you want, but generally your odds of being respected are a lot better if you've done things to earn respect...simply asking for respect--and complaining about not being respected--rarely works well."

As a mature human child or adult you take care of yourself and the area at which you live. No excuses. It made things that were tedious or annoying just be a thing to check off the list every week. And made some of the actions almost enjoyable or meditative. Everyday after work I come home and do the dishes. Just as a reflex. It gives me time to switch into home mode and the running water and white noise just lets me wash the day off me physically and mentally. And then if I have anything I need to discuss with my partner it’s given me ample time to collect my thoughts and process any emotions that come with them so I don’t over load my partner in case their day was stressful.\n\nEdit: thank you for all the awards. This is my first time receiving them so I don’t know what to say. But thank you to all who commented I wish everyone a happy holidays!\n\nEdit 2: some people mentioned how do you get kids to learn to do chores or clean up after themselves without punishment or reward. And the answer is depends... haha. Some kids will understand and process things through a positive reinforcement and some will through a negative reinforcement. If you can help it it’s better just to develop a routine habit so it’s not something they have to actively think about doing or not. And you can start by example. If you’re showing them how to take care of your home and you actively invite them to help and join in. Most people will naturally want to help/ be included. Especially kids, if you make it fun. And with kids you can disguise almost anything into a game. \n\nI also find it very helpful to explain why. Most people even kids run off some form of logic. And if you can rationalize why some action is valuable or beneficial to them and can show the results of that action. It makes it much easier to reinforce that type of behavior."

We're like a car with the engine constantly running. That means we're ready to go from zero to a 100 right away but we're also guzzling gas constantly, even if we're standing still. That's why warm blooded animals need toc constantly eat. Some of the smaller more high energy creatures like humming birds can starve to death in a matter of hours.\n\nBy comparison, cold blooded animals waste zero energy on body heat. The downside is that they need to warm their bodies up with external heat like sunlight in order to get their digestive enzymes working or to get their muscles ready for fast action.\n\nBut on the upside, they need so little energy that they have to take far fewer risks than warm blooded animals.

They aren't even the biggest. That distinction goes to ES&S. ES&S has had a littany of issues over the years, and their former CEO quit to run for congress in a state that using his machines. He went from polling way down before the race, to winning by 17%.\n\nGee, where have we seen that before?\n\nMaybe Maine, where Susan Collins spent the entire last year losing in every poll, by about 8-10%. She won her race by 9%. Roughly a 17% flip.\n\nWho's machines handle all of the ballots in Maine, including the mail in? ES&S. And since the race is soooo far apart, there will never be an audit of the equipment.\n\nBut it's just like, one race, right?\n\nNo. Of course not. This year, South Carolina spent $51 million on new ES&S equipment. Lindsay Graham went from polling down 1-2%, to winning by 10%.\n\nIn Iowa, Jodi Ernst went from polling down around 3 points in nearly every poll, to winning by 6.5%. Just shy of a ten point swing.\n\nIn Montana, Daines was within a few points, generally even, with his competitor Bullock. Daines won his race 55-45, another magical 10 point swing for the Republicans.\n\nEvery senate race, where ES&S machines were used, we had crazy swings like this, and the results of every ES&S senate race went for the Republicans by so much, that no recount or audit will ever be performed.\n\nBack in Georgia, in the 2018 gubernatorial race, there was quite a bit of tomfuckery too. Kemp \"won\" a pretty disputed race against the Democrat Stacey Abrams. Part of the issues revolving around the race, were that not only was Kemp overseeing his own election, but he had ties to the company who's equipment they were using. ES&S. The equipment ended up not having any paper back ups, and the results were all erased, so no audit. Oops. For this election, they went with Dominion, after Democrats blocked attempts to purchase more ES&S equipment.\n\nIt's not like any of this is a huge secret. ES&S has been getting eyeballed since their tomfuckery in Florida, during the 2000 race. They weren't the hanging chads, they were the ones that \"mistakenly\" gave Bush a bunch of votes in a county, allowing him to call himself the winner, helping to justify his pushes in court.\n\nDisturbing revelations have been surfacing about ES&S for a while now. Stuff like selling machines that have remote access enabled, allowing anyone from anywhere to access the devices and alter data and configurations as they see fit.\n\nBut we will NEVER hear a Republican say they want those machines looked at closely.\n\nThe information is out there, readily available, but Dems are lousy at going on the offensive  :("

Code reviews, writing specs, reading other people's specs, and tracking down people to try to explain the bug they filed or find a repro are all core software development skills.  That's not an exhaustive list either.\n\nThat said, the answer varies from company to company, but the general trend is that you spend less hours writing code as you get more senior.  Even a Senior/Principal independent contributor will have to spend more time in meetings coordinating things with other teams.\n\nAfter 11 years in software, I occasionally have to remember to make time for coding.  Realistically, there are so many areas I \"own\", so many features I'm coordinating with other teams, and so many junior devs who seek me out for advice or assistance that I could absolutely go almost an entire week dealing with emails, IMs, code reiviews, and docs, and not write a line of code.  A substantial part of my performance review is tied to delivering things, so I have to make that time, but time management is an increasingly important skill.  I have to carve out blocks of coding time and make the most of them.  Thankfully, years of experience (should) also make you much more efficient, both by mastering your tools and by knowing a system well enough to design things to be maintainable and easy to extend."

        "content": "Sorry, I don't speak your language and am running off translator, but I have to disagree with the idea that burying waste is not a solution.\n\nYour nation reprocesses all of its waste (and the wastes of other countries too). The uranium and plutonium is separated out to make more reactor fuel while the fission products that make up about 2 to 4% of the mass of the fuel is encapsulated in glass and currently stored at La Hague. It's such a compact amount of waste it is literally stored in a single room.\n\nThat waste could easily be buried. It contains very little energy value, and the isotopes in it are not very valuable either due to low demand.\n\nYour government could take oil drilling equipment like is used in the oil industry everywhere, drill a 1000mm wide borehole to 3000m to 4000m almost anywhere in France to reach bedrock, and then drop all of France's civilian nuclear waste in that hole. Once backfilled with with dolomite, there is essentially zero water movement at that depth due to it being bedrock. Any water movement there is occurs at very slow rates (<mm/year) and it would be into hyper-saline aquifers that no one uses. It will be tens to hundreds of millions of years before it ever reaches anything of note, long after the waste has stopped being an issue, which for reprocessed waste with plutonium removed is less than 1000 years.\n\nIt is a solution. It is a solution that was solved many many years ago. All there is now is for the politicians to do their jobs and get it implemented.\n\nI commend your nation's use of nuclear energy. It's the gold standard to solving the issue of climate change. If the Germans had spent a fraction of the ~30b Euro they spent on Energiewende each year on nuclear they'd have completely decarbonised their electricity grid several years ago and would now be onto decarbonising the hard things like cars and industry. Instead they have squandered the opportunity, and Germany is now little better than they were 20 years ago. Most of their emissions reductions come from closing coal plants and opening gas plants. An improvement, but in no way sustainable.\n\nThe talk of switching France to wind and solar is scary. It's what the oil industry wants as it's their natural gas that will back up wind and solar when the weather or time of day is not favourable."

        "content": "Physics and cost.\n\nThe theoretical efficiency limit is 95%. This is solely determined by the temperature of the sun and the temperature of earth. Whatever you do, a higher efficiency is never possible.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of limitations. First, the solar panel has to *send out* light as well: the temperature of the panel is above absolute zero, so it emits heat. This brings it down to 86.8%. But that assumes that the incoming light comes from every direction at once. In practice, the sun only covers a small part of the sky, bringing it even further down to 68.7%. And that's still with a perfect solar cell! That assumes the cell is infinitely thick and has zero losses.\n\nIf we try to actually build cells, the best we can currently do is around 44.4%, which isn't too bad! But those cells consist of multiple layers, use exotic materials, and are very expensive to construct. It is *way* cheaper to construct less complicated cells. Turns out we don't really care about the absolute efficiency: there is plenty of sunlight available. We just want the most power at the lowest cost.\n\nThe most common (and cheapest) cell type is \"single-junction\". The theoretical efficiency limit for those is 33.16%. Then we have some losses due to the protective coating, the wiring, being unable to cover 100% of the panel with cells, and loooots of other small stuff.\n\nSo yeah, it might not sound like much, but an efficiency in the 20ish% isn't too bad. Don't expect anything over 30% soon, because we're already rapidly approaching the limits of physics!"

The number of times I've reviewed a design doc and had to say \"the first paragraph should tell you enough to know whether you need to read the rest of the document\" is legion. :-) The \"don't explain in person, fix the documentation\" advice is common to all forms of written communication. If someone asks you a question about your document, don't answer the question. Just fix the documentation, and answer \"check again and tell me if it's clear now.\"  Eventually you stop getting questions.\n\nAs for \"prove a bug isn't there,\" this is where self-documenting code falls down. Code can't be self-documenting if the code isn't there. So the comment \"no need to check for buffer overflow here because ...\" is necessary.\n\nI think I'm going to really miss Google's code review platform, which deals with about half of the things here automatically. :-)"

The muzzle brake redirects gas backwards as it exits the barrel and pushes the gun forwards to counteract the backwards push from the bullet.\n\nMuzzle rise and horizontal deflection are from the stock pushing back on you, and you moving around.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people are saying that climb and deflection are just effects of recoil. They are, but it's an important distinction because you have muzzle brakes that reduce recoil, and then you have compensators (basically the same idea, but the vents point directly up or to the sides rather than backwards) that are designed to fight climb and deflection rather than recoil."

        "content": "Generally the way the hash is stored tells you what kind of hash it is.  This is because the reason for a website to store the hash is so that they can take the user password which has just been input, hash it, and compare the resulting hash with the hash stored on file -- this allows them to determine if the correct password was entered without having to store the user's password in an unprotected manner.  But in order to be able to hash the current input, the software needs to know what hashing algorithm was used, so it can hash the current input with the same algorithm.  Typically, a stored \"hash\" will look something like this:\n\n    $1$saltsalt$4iXfpnrgHRXkrDbPymCE4/\n\nThe \"1\" between the first pair of dollar-signs means \"md5 hash\". The next part that says \"saltsalt\", is arbitrary text that is supposed to be added onto the password before hashing. That should be different text for every stored password hash, so that an attacker cannot simply hash a single password and compare the result against the entire database of passwords. Since each entry has a different arbitrary \"salt\" value added to it before the hashing process, even if two users have the same password, the final hash result will be different for the different entries, because of the different salt values. The last part after the final dollar sign is the actual hash, probably base64 encoded in this example.  Sometimes there is also an additional field for how many times to run the hashing algorithm, with each successive run taking the hash of the previous round's hash result.\n\nHowever, even in cases where the hash was just stored as the hash data with no extra information, you can usually make an educated guess based simply on the length of the hash. Md5 hashes are 16 bytes, sha1 are 20 bytes, sha256 are 32 bytes, and sha512 are 64 bytes. And generally when they are stored in a just-the-hash-without-additional-information manner, then the data/password was just hashed one time with the hash function and no salt.  That's not always the case, but it's the most likely.\n\nSo if I give you this:\n\n    bb79ae66cdbacdb49a938fd71141029f9861ad36\n\nAnd you put that in software that tells you what kind of hash something is, it will probably tell you it's a sha1 hash. It's not. That's just 20 random bytes I generated. But sha1 is the most probable guess if you tell me you're sure it's a hash of some sort."

        "content": "Alcohol has a numbing dampening effect on the brain. You might have heard alcohol called a \"depressant\" for this reason. If your brain didn't rapidly adapt to cope with this you would stop breathing pass out and die. It does so by increasing the activity in your brain. (less ELI5, alcohol dampens neuronal activity and to cope GABA - the major inhibitory neutrotransmitter is reduced.)\n\nAs the alcohol wears off (your body processes about 1 unit of alcohol per hour) and now your body is having to cope with the changes it had to make to deal with the alcohol. (Now the alcohol has worn off your body has to return to it's normal state except your neurons are more \"twitchy\" than they ought to be as GABA is being ignored).\n\nWhile on alcohol you felt relaxed, calm and subdued and sleepy - until your brain adapted now you feel the opposite. Until your brain adapts back.\n\nIn this state your body begins to produce stress hormones like Cortisol, you begin to worry and feel stressed out. One under recognised \"hang over\" effect of alcohol is feelings of guild and shame.\n\nThis combined produces \"early morning waking\" which is a symptom of psychological distress in humans.\n\nYou're tired but your brain is wired and you can't sleep. You're anxious and stressed as your brain is overwhelmed with input and tuned for when you were drunk not sober. Invariably you might find yourself stressing about what you might have done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis cycle actually worsens the more alcohol you consume. And so \"alcoholic\" rapidly become tolerant to alcohol feeling anxious despite drinking, and as it wears off neuronal activity can increase so much that they begin hallucinating, shaking and eventually have seizures. For this reason Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal."

        "content": "Electrical engineer here. You can't really get the voltage wrong like that, not unless conductors at two different voltages touch, but that's very unlikely. Transformers do have tap changers, however at those voltages they're typically off load (you have to turn the transformer off to change the tap and secondary voltage, if you try to do it while on it will blow up). You tend to only get automatic on load tap changers (OLTCs, ABB have some really good documents on them) at grid level transmission voltages.\n\nMy guess is (and it really is a guess I'm pulling out of my ass) the network is simply overloaded, and after the trip they tried to switch the supply back on without the load demand, leaving the voltage too high on the network such that their clearance distances between phases was no longer sufficient.\n\nEdit: there's also a possibility that the lines were stretched due to electromotive forces in a fault. This could reduce the clearance distance between the phases, and it fits what someone else said about the arcing occurring in the middle of the lines rather than at the insulators. Although, now that I think a tiny bit more, the voltage difference between the line and the earthed pole (across the insulator) is less than the voltage between any two phases (across the air between the lines), so it could still be a higher than nominal voltage rather than clearance distance. Or maybe both.\n\nEither way, they put the cables too close together.\n\n[Here's a fun video highlighting the electromotive force of a cable under fault](https://youtu.be/_i2L-CCJoDI), and why you should properly cleat cables (not much you can do about overhead lines).\n\n[And here's another fun video of a test of a 400kV circuit breaker](https://youtu.be/Jcqu1ayXkYk), taken from a distance with mostly just sound (can't actually see the breaker being operated)."

When you let intolerant idiots drown you out there is no \"free and fair exchange of ideas\", which is why restricting and suppressing certain anti-democratic and intolerant forms of speech is essential to preserve democracy.\n\nMany Conservatives meet anything that threatens or challenges their fragile beliefs and worldview with intolerance, these people cannot be reasoned with until they decide to be open to rational and civil discourse. Failing to confront and address their intolerance only allows it to spread unchecked. Which is why it is essential to deplatform and remove intolerant and bigoted speech and symbols from public. The Paradox of Tolerance is a valid justification for the removal and suppression of intolerant behavior and viewpoints.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance\n\n>Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.\n\nThe Allies tore down Nazi iconography and destroyed their means of spreading propaganda to end the glorification and spread of Nazism, just as has been done with symbols and monuments dedicated to the Confederacy and Confederate soldiers, just as Osama Bin Laden's body was buried at sea to prevent conservative Islamofascists turning his burial site into a \"terrorist shrine\". Radio stations in Rwanda spread hateful messages that radicalized the Hutus which began a wave of discrimination, oppression, and eventual genocide.\n\n**The only result of permitting intolerant and bigoted views and symbols in public is to openly promote and facilitate their proliferation through society which inevitably ends with a less free and less tolerant society.**"

An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. \n\nTwo weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. \n\nThe loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. \n\nWhat puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000?” The blond replies:\n\n”Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?”"

I'll put a reply i made here to clarify a little more\n\n\"The other 1000 camps you can kind of consider as processing facilities (at first) where they would separate those would could work, sub-divide the different groups of people, etc. Those 6 camps were specifically designed to have people transported in from all over the theater for the sole purpose of being killed as efficiently as possible.\n\nI said \"at first,\" because as the war went on, pretty much every camp was home to unspeakable horror as people were starved to death, experimented upon, and so forth. Im sure others have a far better explanation than I do, but the difference is mainly what the original intended purpose of the camps were.\"\n\nI also was able to get a unique perspective on WW2 and the Holocaust before school. My cousin was a field grade officer in the European Theater and was actually one of the first Americans to go into a concentration camp. I have a letter from him where he describes his experiences.

Certains partis politiques afghans s'y sont alliés, d'autres ont combattu (comme Jamaat-e Islami). Ben Laden a vu le potentiel des talibans et s'est allié à eux.

        "content": "SQL and Machine Learning have a few things in common. It’s easy to start with one as it doesn’t require a lot of coding. Also, code rarely crashes.\n\nI would argue that the fact that the SQL queries don’t crash makes the Data Analysis even harder. How many datasets I’ve extracted from the database, that turned out to have wrong or missing data? Many!\n\n# 1. Not knowing in what order queries execute\n\n[SQL query execution order](https://preview.redd.it/ncty0v0e7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfa8f55df0828f3ef61534b78d8668bfc7615a3)\n\nSQL has a low barrier to entry. You start writing queries — use a JOIN here and there, do some grouping and you’re already an expert (at least some people think so).\n\n**But does the so-called expert even know in what order do SQL queries execute?**\n\nSQL queries don’t start with SELECT — they do in the editor when we write them, but the database doesn’t start with SELECT.\n\nThe database starts executing queries with FROM and JOIN. That’s why we can use fields from JOINed tables in WHERE.\n\nWhy can’t we filter the result of GROUP BY in WHERE? Because GROUP BY executes after WHERE. Hence, the reason for HAVING.\n\nAt last, we come to SELECT. It selects which columns to include and defines which aggregations to calculate. Also, Window Functions execute here.\n\nThis explains why we get an error when we try to filter with the output of a Window Function in WHERE.\n\n# 2. What do Window Functions actually do?\n\n[Example of a transformation with a SUM Window Function](https://preview.redd.it/jxz0203i7my51.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b04a2a8be6a2e73493a00137cddae123fae43ee6)\n\nWindow Functions seemed cryptic to me when I first encountered them. Why use Window Functions as GROUP BY can aggregate the data?\n\nWell, a Window Function (WF) simplifies many operations when designing queries:\n\n* WF allows access to the records right before and after the current record. See Lead and Lag functions.\n* WF can perform an additional aggregation on already aggregated data with GROUP BY. See the example in the image above, where I calculate sales all with a WF.\n* ROW\\_NUMBER WF enumerates the rows. We can also use it to remove duplicate records with it. Or to take a random sample.\n* As the name suggests WF can calculate statistics on a given window:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    sum(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID BY ts ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as cumulative_sum\n\nThe WF above would calculate the cumulative sum from the first record to the current record.\n\n**Where did I do a mistake with Window Functions?**\n\nI didn’t take the time for a tutorial that would explain the basics and the power of Window Functions. Consequently, I avoided them and the queries became overcomplicated. Then bugs creep in.\n\n**Run the example**\n\nI got many requests from readers that would like to play with the example above. Now, you can run the example online in [SQL Fiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!15/9eecb7db59d16c80417c72d1e1f4fbf1/35342).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee [Don’t Make These 5 Mistakes with SQL](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-repeat-these-5-mistakes-with-sql-9f61d6f5324f?sk=a688d76b0fa3fc4c737552aedcbe5aad) for more.\n\nThanks for reading.

        "content": "^ This post here pretty much nails it. I'm a critical incident manager for a fortune 500 company with a large IT footprint. This is a good representation for most large companies that subscribe to ITIL standards.\n\nGenerally, when you have something large go out like this, you get alerts from multiple directions simultaneously. A ticket is created, or one is designated as the master in the case of auto-generation, and it's escalated up to a major/critical incident management team.\n\nFrom there, communications go out, the scope of communication increases as the total impact increases. In the case of major outage of a very public consumer facing website IE Youtube, the communication probably gets blown out to all the internal IT teams, upper management, and potentially any business/communication departments that may also need to issue a statement to anyone outside the company.\n\nFrom there, all IT teams convene on a central call. A secondary and even a tertiary call may also be created for the internal business and/or impacted customer sides.\n\nGenerally an incident manager acts as the main voice for the call, pulling in teams/individuals that are needed, requesting information or assigning tasks to other teams/individuals as needed, and keeping notes including timelines and current efforts in case they are needed. \n\nTeams generally are first asked to perform check-ins on their current environment health, IE database team checks in on database performance statistics and availability. Network teams are looking for any ongoing issues on their layer etc.\n\nRecent changes are immediately one of the first things brought up. ~75% of large incidents like this are in some way related to a change that was performed either in house or externally. \n\nFrom that point, everyone just starts digging into all their tools and throwing out ideas for where to look next. Someone points out all the requests from one coast endpoint are timing out, but from the opposite coast are still functioning, Network team starts checking pathing. Someone else points out incoming requests come in via one of two different gateways depending on the origin point. Teams start investigating the gateways/firewalls etc for both entry points. \n\nEventually someone finds something like an expired certificate, or a rule change that was implemented without correct vetting. From there, a new cert is created/applied, or the rule change is rolled back. \n\nImmediately after some action is taken, you've got users on the call either testing themselves, or reaching out to someone that can test and report back. If everything's still broke, we continue digging in another direction."

The more you see a \"fake\" version of somebody during an interview, the less likely your interview experience will match their normal behavior and abilities.\n\nThis comes up a lot with politicians. The best campaigners don't necessarily make the best politicians - in fact sometimes it's quite the opposite.\n\nWhen you have a huge industry that exists solely to train peop6for interviews, you're probably more seeing the degree to which a person paid for prep classes than you are that they'd make a great teammate. Similarly, you're lowering your pool diversity by dropping all the people who didn't or couldn't pay for the classes as they now look worse than your pool's average.\n\nThis kind of works when the job is very predictable and mechanical because interviews can get really close to the day to day work. But while some folks pretend programming is predictable and mechanical - like a programmer chooses an algorithm the way an plumber chooses the right pipe - it isn't really, and the pieces that are aren't where teams typically fail anyway. \n\nIn short, I think the existence of that cottage industry is a sign that companies like Google, Amazon, facebook, etc. have gotten big, bureaucratic, and lazy."

I (46M) can relate to you in some degree any your upbringing, and your views.\n\nI encourage you to consider women to be your equal. They are humans just like you. While they operate very differently from us men, they are still equal add humans. Do not place them on pedestals, and so not treat them as objects.\n\nThe problem I had written my upbringing is that I had to learn the hard way many of the things that I know now.\n\nHere is a condensed version. Honesty and authenticity is everything. Period. Be authentic in who you are. If all you want is sex, be honest enough with yourself and with women about that. So not expect to get anything, but rather accept that some women will be OK and others will not. If you respect them you will honor their decision for themselves.\n\nIf you want something more meaningful, again be authentic and know this about yourself. Do not wish into sex. Biologically, your testosterone is running rampant. You can control what you want for you. It will be difficult. \n\nTalk to any and every woman you come into contact with. This will help you get comfortable and realize women are no different from you. Lower your expectations. Expect nothing but a good conversation. A women will grow closer to you if she feels safe with you. \n\nI was 22 when I lost my virginity. Honestly, it was not at all what I expected. The first time I had sex with someone I truly loved was so much better. Work on knowing who you are, what you want, what you stand for and in time you will find what you are looking for.\n\nIf you only want sex, know that and be honest about that, too. I have had fast more success from expecting nothing and being 100% honest than most people experienced lying.\n\nI wish you the best. Be well."

        "content": "Every virus needs to attach to a specific protein on a cell's membrane in order to enter the cell and do its thing. This virus uses ACE2 which is mainly found in the lungs and normally helps ~~increase~~ decrease blood pressure, believe it or not. So it's essentially like the doorknob this virus uses to enter the cell. The logic behind this treatment is that scientists made a bunch of these doorknobs that aren't attached to cells. Thus, the virus will bind to these doorknobs instead of the ones on the host cells, reducing the ability of the virus to spread \n \nEdit: I'll add this here since a lot of people (myself included) have been confused about this point. ACE indeed normally does help increase blood pressure, but it turns out this virus binds to ACE2. They are similar enzymes, but they facilitate reverse reactions. ACE makes more angiotensin II while ACE2 breaks down angiotensin II. Seems like there's some research into how the ratio of these 2 enzymes factor into blood pressure. The exact function of these enzymes isn't what is important here though. The main reason we care about them for covid isn't their function, but rather just because they allow the virus to enter cells in the lungs and several other tissues \n \nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.00335/full"

Ceux qui font des efforts en ce sens (restreindre sa religion à la sphère privée, changer de nom...) sont systématiquement insultés ou dénigrés.

Lorsque des individus contournent les lois françaises pour pouvoir contourner les valeurs françaises, bien sûr  qu'il faut de nouvelles lois adaptées à des agressions qui prennent de nouvelles formes.

Observations helps mix things up instead of asking questions and lets the person know you're listening. \n\nFinally, anecdotes and the longer version - stories. The first one is fairly easy to come up with, stories are much harder and there's no easy way to practice this beyond hearing how other people describe their stories, and having experiences that are unique to you since this helps you vocalize your stories naturally.\n\nPractice is important. Listening is important. Try reading a book out loud alone so you're more comfortable with your voice. Lastly, not every conversation will go swimmingly even if you follow all advice.

Because I want you to think about it… what is this \"yourself\" that everyone speaks of? How do you know if you're being yourself or not? \r\n\r\nMost people might say that you're \"yourself\" when you feel natural and at ease. But here's the thing: if you want to transform yourself into a person who is more social or a better conversationalist… someone who is engaging, fun, and can  make friends and deepen connections; then you might have to do some things that don't feel comfortable or put you at ease (at least the current version of you).\r\n\r\nBut this is the same as someone learning to play the piano-- at first it will be uncomfortable and frustrating-- but the more you practice, the more smooth it will become. \r\n\r\n***Don't be yourself.***\r\n\r\nStart being the future you that you want to be instead. In time, it will become the new \"you.\" That's how change happens!\r\n\r\nYou probably can visualize the type of person you'd like to be.

Ce n'est pas parce que certaines infos sont moins relayées que d'autres par nos médias qu'elles n'existent pas.

Et ce ne sont pas tant les dessins mais la position de Macron qui a provoqué cette vague de réactions. Position qui pour le coup était on ne peut plus respectable mais qui a été habilement déformée par des gens qui ont tout à gagner à ce que la populace oublie sa misère pour aller taper sur un ennemi commun. Rien de mieux qu'une bonne polémique sur les méchants français/occidentaux pour renforcer l'autorité du leader, qui en ressort grandit car premier défenseur du pays, et faire oublier aux gens les divers problèmes sociaux et économiques qui rongent la santé du pays.\n\nC'est quand même dommage de ne pas faire la différence entre état et population et de faire toujours les mêmes généralisations."

But the pharmaceutical companies made some minor changes and then patented that. That's why they can sell it for these exorbitant prices.\n\nBanting and his colleagues would be spinning in their graves today.\n\nEdit: I should have rather said \"incremental changes\". As pointed out by a few comments below, a lot of effort has since been put to make insulin safer and effective. However, after Frederick Sanger discovered the structure of human insulin and thus enabling the manufacturing a synthetic version using modern methods there are no excuses for the unfair pricing.\n\nPS - Both Banting (1923) and Sanger (1958) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for thier work on insulin."

First, the age profile of those watching is likely to be young. They are less likely to vote.\n\nThe entire point is in fact to reach out to young voters and convince them to vote *because* they are the ones that are less likely. What's the point in convincing likely voters to vote -- they already are. Of course you target groups that need convincing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Second, political opponents are probably less likely to participate. Third, it's not changing people's minds on anything.\"\n\nThis wasn't a discussion intended to change minds. It was an exercise intended to humanize politics and convince people to actually get out and vote, not change which party they intend to vote for. Streaming games exemplifies AOC and Ilhan as normal people, helping young voters feel connected, rather than detached from a political process orchestrated by old millionaires they will never have anything in common with.\n\nSurprising to me that a professor of politics could seemingly miss the point entirely. But maybe that is exactly why younger politicians like AOC and Ilhan are coming up with creative ways to connect, while others remain locked into antiquated approaches. Or maybe he just doesn't like them and would rather reach for a negative spin.\n\n*Edit:*\n\nThere is a lot of discussion about the age group being reached. It is important to note that a significant majority of Twitch's user base, [per 2020 stats](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/twitch-statistics/), is over 18. It's hard to give exact values restricted to just the US viewers, but it is a safe bet to say that a majority of live viewers were over 18.\n\nFurthermore, as many have said, outreach to younger audiences can plant seeds for the future - it's obviously beneficial to be the one planting them. I am going off my own memory here, but I do recall AOC directly addressing the younger audience during the end of her stream. They can still discuss voting with their family and friends, talk about voting plans, etc. Reaching younger teens is not negligible, especially when the cost of doing so was as low as in this instance."

Meanwhile, as they spend the new money, and the next wave of recipients spend it, and so on, prices begin to rise throughout the economy--well before the new money has trickled down to most people. The average person is now paying higher prices while still earning his old income, which has not yet been adjusted to account for the higher money supply. By the time the new money has made its way throughout the economy, average people have all this time been paying higher prices, and only now can begin to break even."

        "content": "This remains the single biggest mystery of Trump's finances. The freaking scottish golf courses. [NY Times Deutsche Bank expert David Enrich](https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1317564559331364876):\n\n>This is kind of perplexing, **given how badly his existing courses are performing** and how his businesses overall appear to be bleeding cash.\n\nHis Scottish courses have always been, and will be for the foreseeable future, [money pits](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/where-did-donald-trump-get-200-million-dollars-to-buy-his-money-losing-scottish-golf-club) that devour hundreds of millions in renovation without ever turning a profit. His [tax returns](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html) revealed that they have soaked up every bit of liquidity he has, so that he has virtually nothing at hand to pay off the $400 million in debt coming due in the next few years.\n\n[Deutsche Bank finally turned off the spigot](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html) in 2016 when he tried to bail out the Turnberry course, and refuses to loan him any more money for these courses, Turnberry in particular.\n\nThey make absolutely no sense. So why does he put every penny he has into them? The cover story is that it's wistful nostalgia for the homeland of his mother, and in fact this new course is going to be named \"MacLeod\" after her. Seems a little on the nose for a man who shows no capacity for sentimentality.\n\nThe more likely reason? Money-laundering. Golf courses have basically no comps, so they are very difficult to value. Renovation (like Turnberry) and construction (like this new course) are perfect vehicles for money-laundering, and in fact Trump got all of his wealth initially - some $400 million - via a massive tax evasion scheme orchestrated over decades by his father, which routed payments to him [via a fake construction contracting company](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) called \"All County Building Supply and Maintenance\". And Scotland has notoriously weak laws against money laundering, and [is a popular haven for Russian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/22/labour-on-russian-money-laundering-scotland-shell-companies) money laundering in particular. \n\nAmazingly, Eric Trump himself [reportedly confirmed to Golf Writer James Dodson in  2014](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/eric-trump-russia-investment-golf-course) that all of the money they were spending on golf courses was coming from Russia:\n\n>\"And this is what he said. He said, **'Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.' I said, 'Really?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah. We’ve got some guys that really, really love golf**, and they’re really invested in our programs. We just go there all the time.’\"\n\nSomewhat shockingly, Mueller obeyed Trump's order [not to look into his finances](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-23/mueller-failed-to-follow-trump-s-money-trail) out of fear of getting fired. Thankfully, private citizen Trump will have no such leverage at his disposal."

        "content": "Cela fait plusieurs mois que cette impression grandit en moi. J'ai d'abord vu apparaître des anti-masques et des négationnistes de la pandémie, jusque dans mon entourage, puis des gens qui ne voulaient pas respecter les règles du confinement ou qui les tordaient à leur avantage. C'est allé de mon père allant plusieurs fois changer l'imprimante de mes grands-parents vulnérables en plein confinement, à des voisins invitant des gens tous les trois jours pour des soirées alors que l'isolement était la règle. \n\nMon sentiment de rupture, de colère/tristesse sourde et d'incapacité à comprendre s'est encore renforcé il y a quelques jours. \n\nMa belle-sœur a soudainement décidé de se marier le 12 décembre. Je dis \"soudainement\" non par moquerie, mais pour ne pas que l'on croie que le mariage était prévu en amont : elle a appris qu'elle était enceinte et la mairie n'avait plus que ce créneau de disponible, d'où son choix. Le futur marié est déjà divorcé, le mariage ne peut donc avoir lieu à l'église. L'événement se tiendra dans une mairie en Allemagne, où les rassemblements de 25 personnes sont encore autorisés. Ils y aura donc 23 invités et un repas collectif au restaurant. \n\nAlors que j'aurais dû me réjouir pour les futurs mariés et parents, j'ai passé trois jours déprimée, anxieuse et en colère. Je ne comprenais pas comment c'était possible d'être assez irresponsable pour vouloir se marier en plein début de deuxième vague de Covid-19, enfant à venir ou pas. Je savais qu'il y aurait des personnes de plus de 65 ans à risque dans l'assemblée, puisque seule la famille proche avait pu être conviée. J'en voulais à ma belle-famille de me mettre dans une position intenable, où je pouvais soit : \n\n- venir au mariage en marchant allègrement sur tout ce que j'avais essayé de faire pour respecter les règles sanitaires depuis le début de la pandémie et en risquant de transmettre/contracter le virus\n\n- risquer de fâcher m'a belle-famile en décidant de ne pas venir à ce mariage à cause de tous les risques.\n\nJ'ai opté pour la seconde solution lorsque j'ai réalisé, après un échange de mail avec ma belle-mère, que le mariage ne serait pas reporté. J'ai expliqué, en restant extrêmement polie malgré ma colère, que je ne viendrais pas au mariage, car je ne me sentais pas sereine vis-à-vis de ma propre responsabilité dans la potentielle transmission du virus. J'ai également informé, tout en la félicitant, la future mariée, et j'ai attendu anxieusement leurs réponses. \n\nMon compagnon, quant à lui, a décidé d'attendre pour prendre sa décision. Il espère à demi-mot que les mesures de sécurité sanitaires auront tellement augmentées d'ici là qu'il n'aura pas à choisir. Nous savons tout les deux que rien d'autre ne fera annuler ce mariage.\n\nLes réponses de ma belle-famille ont été compréhensives, montrant que j'avais tort de m'inquiéter à ce sujet. Néanmoins, je n'en reviens toujours pas d'avoir eu à faire un tel choix, alors qu'il semble relever du sens commun de reporter ce type d'événement ou bien de le retransmettre par vidéo, deux options que j'avais suggérées dans mon premier mail. Certaines personnes tiennent juste absolument à faire presque comme si tout allait normalement. \"Ils faut bien vivre\", ai-je souvent entendu ces derniers mois. \n\nJe me sens vraiment déconnectée de cette façon de penser. Des personnes qui ne veulent pas respecter le port du masque jusqu'à celles qui, dès mercredi soir, cherchait des stratégies pour enfreindre le futur couvre-feu, je me sens profondément étrangère. Ce n'est pas que je ne puisse pas avoir de la compréhension et de l'empathie pour ce qui motive leur position (une impression de privation de liberté, une envie de revenir au rythme de vie pré-Covid au plus tôt, de la réactance vis-à-vis des mesures prises par le gouvernement, etc.), mais ça ne m'empêche pas de ne rien comprendre à ce qui se passe dans leur tête.\n\nJe sais que je ne suis pas la seule à ressentir cette rupture, mais cela me fait tout de même me sentir isolée psychologiquement, comme si je ne pouvais désormais plus faire confiance à mes soeurs et frères humains. Cela m'a fait comprendre pourquoi nous sommes tous très mal partis pour changer collectivement nos modes de vie afin de lutter contre le réchauffement climatique : il paraît impossible que le monde entier se lie dans un même effort derrière une cause commune, sans parler des multinationales qui n'y ont pas intérêt. Beaucoup de gens ne veulent pas modifier leurs habitudes. \n\nJ'ai une question sous forme d'ouverture pour les personnes qui sont dans mon cas : à quoi vous raccrochez-vous, devant ce genre de constat, pour garder de l'espoir ?\n\nEdit : un TL;DR par u/LordVen0m et modifié par mes soins : \n\n>Se rendre compte que le pourcentage de personnes à la morale et l’éthique « variable » est largement au dessus que ce qu’on imaginait n’a pas tendance à te donner foi en l’humanité."

        "content": "Historian here. I actually specialized in contemporary german history.\n\nFirst, before anything, the holocaust was real. We have all sorts of evidence, from the actual camps being found by US and Soviet troops, to reports from the SS and Wehrmacht, to official telegrams between party officials to of course, the witnesses of both victims and criminals.\n\nI have seen with my own eyes letters from Hitler and Ribbentrop, from 1938 discussing the plans to repress and discredit Jewish populations in recent annexed Austria. \n\nThe holocaust numbers are not exaggerated. What we have are Estimates from the low 2 million to the high 6 million. Those are Jews alone. We also gotta remember that other groups were targeted, specially Slavics, Poles, Roma and Homosexuals and those might bring the death toll to about 10 million.\n\nGermany was not the only perpetrator. Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and other Axis countries took an active part in the holocaust. The Italians had their own camps, the Slovakians had their own death squad units\n\nDue to the nature of this event, it's really hard to get a precise number. This was before the age of computers and information, a lot of people did not have papers, a lot of people lived \"of the grid\", a lot of papers vanished or got destroyed be it by the germans or by allied bombing/fighting.\n\nThe camps were not the only method of killing. The camps are responsible for about 50-60% of killings. A big chunk came from death squads that would decimate entire villages; the Wehrmacht would mark the villages and categorize the population and the SS would do the dirty job.\n\nAll over Europe, villages and towns would have 10 to 30 thousand people executed in mass graves in a single day. \n\nNot all camp deaths happened in the chambers. Most of the deaths happened of starvation, disease, exposure and overwork. Those corpses were either buried in mass or burned in piles.\n\nThe US archives has a big collection of videos taken by US Army units, one of the original films can be seen on Netflix. No narrator, no special modern editing. Just the official footage presented to Eisenhower.\n\nThere is not a single historian with good credentials that denies the holocaust. The same goes for the Holodomor or the Armenian Genocide. Only people with political agendas simping dictators deny such happenings\n\nEdit: Also, don't forget. Even though the final solution was only signed in 1942, the first camps were built starting way back when Dachau opened in 1933. The germans had a lot of time to kill a lot of people\n\nEdit 2: If people want evidence or sources. I highly recomend that yall go to Netflix and look up \"Nazi Concentration Camps\",this is literally the name of the 1945 film made by GIs. Its raw footage was presented to the US Congress in 1945 by the order of Eisenhower and now its avaiable on Netflix unedited. Also, a great book is \"Le Livre de la Deportation\" by Marcel Ruby, Im sure you will find a english copy to read."

        "content": "Your boss likely doesn’t know them as well as you do; this allows them to get kudos from higher up. \n\nExplaining the positive impact of your employee’s actions allows your boss to understand more of what your team does. It also forces you to think about the positive impact in a way you may not have. \n\nAnd this process makes it easier for you to recommend your people for raises/promotions/other recognition because you’ve already helped build/spread a positive reputation for them. \n\nThen save the email (and your boss’s response, if they respond) in your employee’s personnel file to refer back to when you’re writing their annual performance review or award!\n\nEdited to add: Do this for things they do that are exceptional - not ‘thanks for how you always show up for work on time’ but ‘thanks for saving that valuable client who was about to leave but you discovered how to resolve their really complex issue/working with another division to share your expertise to help them build their new process that will help the company reach x more people/that great interview that the governor personally commented on, it made us look really good”\n\nAlso, know your people. If they are embarrassed by direct praise, then just praise them behind their back to others. If they prefer quiet recognition or a cash/time off reward, do that.\n\nAnd if they do always show up to work on time, and that’s notable, mention it to them. Don’t cc others or exaggerate how big a deal it is; on the other hand just because it’s their job doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be recognized for it. “Hey, just want to say I noticed you’re always extremely punctual; may not seem like a big deal to you but it says a lot to me about how you respect other people’s time.

        "content": "This is one of those charts that is utterly, shockingly useless that it isn't even funny. I wish I'd seen this last night but it came out while I was sleeping. Instead it gets thousands of upvotes while I am away. Stay tuned for my upcoming motherboard misconceptions guide that I am working on. Followed by my how to choose a good mobo guide, and tier list based on features, not just VRMs. \n\nFirst of all, it is completely contextless. If you actually watch hardware unboxed they hold up the B550m Pro4 as one of the MOBOs with great VRMs for the budget. This why random charts can be massively misleading. This contextless chart actually seems to contradict things that Hardware Unboxed themselves have said. Without that context, this chart is incredibly misleading. Even worse, is it implies that boards with the faulty I225-V Lan chip, like the B550 strix are good purchases, when the internet on these boards may not function right depending on your router. \n\nPrice for features is one of the largest determiners of MOBO quality, not VRMs. Since this chart does not take into account the price of the board compared to the quality of the VRMs it doesn't actually provide a reasonable comparison. And makes a bunch of good, well priced boards look shitty by not showing how well the VRMs are compared to their price.\n\nNext, It does not actually make clear what this stuff actually means. So people just assume less numbers = more better. VRMs tier. What I mean is pretty much either they work, or they don't. Either your VRMs are capable of doing something or they aren't. The pro4's 81 degrees for a stock Ryzen 3950x while on a test bench without the airflow that a case with decent fans blowing air through is in spec by 20 degrees, it is a little hot, but perfectly fine. I always said the same thing. The pro4 can OC up to an 8 core, and run a 12 or 16 core at stock. NO OC on those 12 or 16 core CPUs unless you really know what you are doing to keep temps in check. \n\nHowever, VRMs are both massively overrated with most users overbuying heavily and heavily underrated at the same time with many more users buying too little and if your board is too crappy, they can cause crashes. Example the awful b450 DS3h for a 3900x that gets suggested here, and then wondering why your computer is crashing post we get like once a week. \n\nEverything I said about the b550m Pro4, B550 Pro4, b550 Phantom Gaming4, Asrock x570 Phantom Gaming 4S, which all use the same VRMs and are very good mobos, stands. \n\nHowever, I would never recommend the B550m Pro4 for a 5900x, unless your plan is to upgrade from a 3600 to a 5900x in the future, and you are on budget now. If you are buying 5900x now, you should spend a little more.\n\nThis because the MOBO just lacks features that will likely be very useful in the next 4-6 years, and there are much better options that don't run slightly hot. The sweet spot for a MOBO and features is in the 160-220 dollar price point right now. So futureproofing is one the most misunderstood concepts here on this site. The vast majority of people on this site, when the say futureproofing what they mean is I want to buy my build and make sure it is viable for the next 4 years that a PC is expected to live, not for the 10 years strawman that gets forced into these people's mouths.\n\nMotherboards are one of easiest ways to future proof for 4 years, because the ports and features won't suffer a performance decline the way your GPU and CPU will. For example, a $500 3070 vs whatever NVIDIA's unannounced $300 dollar GPU will probably be closer in performance in 5 years then you think, both suffering at 4k 60 and 1440 144, whereas both should still be good for 1080p. Whereas you can spend a mere 40 dollars more on a 170 dollar mobo with a 2.5 GB lan chip, better audio, USB-C port (which for some reason many of the boards in the 140-160 dollar price point lack), good VRMs and so on, these features will continue to be good and function at the level for the lifespan of your mother board. A perfect example is the Realtek 8125 2.5 GB lan chip. There is a huge push to expand 2.5 GB internet right now into major cities because it works with the Cat 5e cables in most people's homes. Consumer grade cheap routers came out in july, and I literally just helped someone over PM whose area was getting 2 gigabit internet. You may not get 2.5 GB soon but in the 4-6 years a PC with a 5900x is viable a lot can change, and the realtek 8125 2,5 GB lan chip is superior to the 8111h on the Pro4, so you get something better now, and if you ever need 2.5 GB internet, you get it for cheaper without having to add an add in card (AICs). AICs are almost always more expensive then just buying a better mobo with the features you want. \n\nFor a 5900x. I would recommend a Gigabyte B550 Aorus Pro, The B550 Steel Legend/extreme 4 (which are currently on sale and basically the same board, the Extreme 4 has power/reset buttons), the B550 Tomahawk, The B550 Gaming Edge WIFI if you need wifi 6 for a 5900x. These all have high end audio codecs, amazing VRMs, great I/O on most boards, great internal connectors and so on. Note the Gigabyte lacks an internal connector for case mounted USB-C but does have USB-C on the back, so if your case has a USB-C port the one on the case won't work. And the MSI boards only have 5 USB-A ports so if you use lots of USB ports you may want to look elsewhere. However all these boards are great.\n\nFinally, do not buy ANY board with the faulty intel I225-V lan chip. This chip currently does not work with certain 2.5 GB routers and suffers packet loss when limited to 1 GB speeds, again on some routers. This means most of ASUS's b550 lineup should not be purchased, nor should boards like the B550 Taichi. \n\nTLDR: the chart with context is basically useless. It seemingly contradicts the actual information in the videos by hardware unboxed by making budget boards seem worse, while not explaining where the actual VRMs tiers, or whether those temps are within operating spec. Finally, Don't judge mobos exclusively by their VRMs, Look at the whole featureset of the board and choose a MOBO that is balanced and matches the quality of the CPU and GPU you are purchasing. \n\nHope this helps."

        "content": "VRM refers to the heatsinks and components that regulate the voltage going into the CPU and motherboard. \n\nCPUs need electricity. So that electricity goes into the MB/CPU, and generates heat as it does so. A beefier VRM complex (better heatsink design, better power phase design and components) will regulate that heat more effectively, dispersing it away from the motherboard and lower the VRM temperatures. \n\nVRM is important, but the current “meta” of PC building overstates the importance to be frank. You need enough to handle the CPU you use; CPUs with more cores will draw more power, so 3900+ will require better VRM than the 3600. \n\nYou don’t need the best VRMs in the world unless you plan on doing heavy over clocking (which is a waste of time on Ryzen because PBO is so good), or you routinely do insane workloads like hour long Blender runs; actual gaming doesn’t hit the CPU nearly as hard. \n\nSo, avoid the MBs at the bottom of the list, and get the best price you can on one from the top half of the list."

        "content": "As /u/senocular already pointed out, the tricky thing here is that `{}` is an ambiguous bit of syntax that depending on the context can either be an empty object or an empty code block. You see the same ambiguity more commonly with arrow functions:\n\n    const getEmptyObject = () => {};\n\n    console.log(getEmptyObject());  // undefined\n\nInstead of returning an empty object, we accidentally wrote a function with an empty code block, which implicitly returns `undefined`. We typically resolve the ambiguity with parentheses:\n\n    const getEmptyObjectForReal = () => ({});\n\n    console.log(getEmptyObjectForReal());  // {}\n\nAn empty code block is not valid inside parentheses, but an object literal is, so we get the object we wanted.\n\nSimilarly, in the examples you posted an empty code block is only valid when it is the first syntax in the line. An empty code block cannot follow a `+` or a `===`. So for the first line, the first pair of curlies is read as an empty code block and is evaluated then disappears. Step by step, the first line evaluates like this:\n\n    {} + [] === [] + {}\n       + [] === [] + {}\n       + \"\" === [] + {}\n          0 === [] + {}\n\n          0 === \"\" + {}\n          0 === \"\" + \"[object Object]\"\n          0 === \"[object Object]\"\n          false\n\nWe can test this out by evaluating one side of these at a time:\n\n    {} + [] === 0;                  // true\n    \"[object Object]\" === [] + {};  // true\n\n    [] + {} === \"[object Object]\";  // true\n    \"[object Object]\" === {} + [];  // true\n\nJust like an arrow function, we can force an empty object with parentheses too:\n\n    ({}) + [] === 0;                // false\n\nAnd beware! A console.log has the same effect!\n\n    console.log({} + []);           // [object Object]"

        "content": "I was recently promoted to Director of Engineering and, after taking some time to reflect this weekend, I realized that it looked like my career trajectory was basically entirely luck. I called and messaged an odd dozen of my friends in the industry and, oddly enough, it seems to be that way for a lot of people. I realized there had to be more to it.\n\nHere’s a bullet list of my career history:\n\n• June 2011 - In grad school (for stats), I got a job as a Systems Analyst at $22/hr. At first this was just doing analytics in R, but I learned SQL. The DBA in that department left and I took on a few of his projects, optimizing stored procedures and fixing issues here-and-there in the database. \n\n• December 2013 - I was laid off. I had now graduated, so I had no insurance. It soon became apparent that rent and student loans were gonna burn through whatever savings I had pretty quickly. In February, I took the hit to my ego, moved back to my hometown (which was a lot cheaper CoL), got certified as an MCSA in SQL Server, and started going to local database meetups, looking for jobs.\n\n• March 2014 - I got an interview for a job from one of the people I met at the meetup I was attending. I got it, making 55k as a DBA, partially off the back of my prior experience and the certification, but mostly by asking good questions and selling myself. This was a pretty laid back job, SLAs were not very tight so I got to spend time learning by trying to make our backend systems more efficient and resilient. I started reading about DevOps and quickly became enamored by the concepts. I built automated deployment pipelines for our database schema changes. I started writing tooling and automation around our compliance requirements. I got experience with AWS when we migrated our relatively simple setup there. I spent 5 years at this job, getting cost of living raises every year while desperately trying to pay off student loans. They could afford to pay me more, but they didn’t, so I eventually got fed up and left.\n\n• April 2019 – One of the people I met networking in the local DevOps meetups had an opening for an SRE at his company, and asked me to apply. I interviewed there, and it seemed like a great group. The company was a startup division of much larger firm. The interviews were laid back, we just talked shop for an hour. They asked me how much I was making and I said “It wouldn’t make sense for me to move for less than 115k”. This was, of course, complete horseshit, but not technically a lie. I defined what “made sense for me” after all. They offered me 115k + bonus, and I took it.\n\n• September 2020 – By now, I realized that, while I loved the team I worked with, this job was basically the logical opposite of my last job. It was fast-paced, frenetic, and we had to work hard and be really creative in order to hit milestones. I was learning a ton, and had been promoted, but I had started to feel the beginnings of burnout. In addition to my job, I had been leading brown-bags to teach people how to use the self-service platforms we were building, and consulting internally on other projects. My boss quit suddenly, and I was asked to take his position in the interim. I did, and after taking a crash course on corporate accounting and doing two jobs for a month from hell, I was asked to take the position permanently. I’m now doing a lot better, things have started to stabilize and we’re working on several projects to improve our workflow, which are a lot of fun.\n\nThis cannot be overstated: soft skills are key! While continuous learning is required for any career advancement, it wont help you get lucky. Soft skills enable you to put yourself in a position to take advantage of opportunities you would not be able to otherwise. I got my SRE position easily because the company was in a really tough spot and needed the expertise then and there, and I had gotten to know someone working there who fought for me. I got a promotion off the back of an unexpected departure because the company needed someone now, and I had developed relationship with upper management by offering to volunteer to do internal consulting and knowledge sharing for other product groups. I had realized that the reason I did not get a significant raise or promotion at my second job was because a lot of my work was not visible, just tinkering in the database layer and automating the boring parts of my job, and I wasn’t going to make that same mistake again.\n\nI learned to speak clearly with confidence by pacing around my room at home and practicing presentations, doing mock conversations, even practicing joke delivery. It might sound odd, but none of this comes naturally to me, so I had to learn somehow.\n\nThis had the knock-on effect of giving me some real confidence, when I realized that people were actually listening to me. I pushed to make as much of my work visible to upper management as possible, and where that wasn’t possible, I started going out of my way to do stuff that was more public; teaching, mentoring, organizing internal knowledge-sharing communities, etc. Helping other people is genuinely one of the best things you can do for yourself.\n\nYou never know when an opportunity will come your way. If you care about advancing your career, you should be prepared to seize it. Network, practice your soft skills, and deliver as much visible value as you can.\n\nEDIT: upvoting all the r/humblebrag comments since they make me giggle. This sub helped me out a few years ago when I was bored and frustrated at my last job. I’m just paying it forward."

Are you having an awesome day?\" Not, \"How are you doing today?\" No. \"Are you having an awesome day?\" Which is pretty shitty because it puts the onus on me to disagree with her, like if I'm not having an \"awesome day,\" suddenly I'm the negative one. Usually when people ask how I'm doing, the real answer is I'm doing shitty, but I can't say I'm doing shitty, because I don't even have a good reason to be doing shitty. So if I say, \"I'm doing shitty,\" then they say, \"Why? What's wrong?\" And I have to be like, \"I don't know, all of it?\" So instead, when people ask me how I'm doing, I usually say, \"I am doing so great.\" But when this girl at the Jack in the Box asked me if I was having an awesome day, I thought, well, today I'm actually allowed to feel shitty, today I have a good reason, so I said to her, \"Well, my mom died.\" And she immediately burst into tears. So now *I* have to comfort *her*, which is annoying, and meanwhile, there's a line of people forming behind me, who are all giving me these real judgy looks because I made the Jack in the Box girl cry. And she's bawling, and she's saying, \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,\" and I'm like, \"It's fine, it's fine. I mean, it's not fine, but, you know, it's... fine. And I would like to order a Double Jack Meal, and I've kinda got somewhere to be, so maybe less with the crying and more with the frying, huh?\" And the girl apologizes, again, and she offers me a free churro with my meal. And as I'm leaving, I think, \"I just got a free churro because my mom died.\" No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro.”*"

        "content": "A big number of the questions I often get from people learning to program is about the best way to structure code.\n\nMost tutorials just teach you basic programming logic, and if they talk about the structure of the code is something like \"Modules have classes, classes have functions and functions do things\". Learning how to structure your code requires a lot of practice and experience, and software design&architecture is something that takes a while to learn, but there are important tools that guide you in this task: software design principles.\n\nSome say that people still learning to program can't benefit from learning about this topic, but if I look back I really wish someone told me about these things from the beginning. It would have made a lot of stuff much easier, so I decided to write a series of articles explaining 5 of the most popular/important software principles, the S.O.L.I.D principles.\n\nBriefly, they are:  \n**S for the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP),** which guides you in creating classes that are responsible for one, and only one actor.  \n**O for the Open/Closed Principle(OCP),** which makes your code easy to extend by ensuring that it stays open for extension but closed for modification (this might be the most important of all 5)  \n**L for the Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP),** which keeps semantic consistency in complex inheritance hierarchies, making your classes easier to understand and use.  \n**I for the Interface Segregation Principle(ISP),** which protects objects from depending on the behavior they don't really need.  \n**D for the Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP),** which controls the direction of dependencies in your code, ensuring that it always flows in the direction of more abstract entities.  \n\n\nIf you are interested in the topic, you can find the 5 articles I wrote here:  \n\n\n* [The Single Responsibility Principle](https://www.brainstobytes.com/the-single-responsibility-principle/)\n* [The Open/Closed Principle](https://www.brainstobytes.com/the-open-closed-principle/)\n* [The Liskov Substitution Principle](https://www.brainstobytes.com/the-liskov-substitution-principle/)\n* [The Interface Segregation Principle](https://www.brainstobytes.com/interface-segregation-principle/)\n* [Dependency Injection and the famous DIP](https://www.brainstobytes.com/dependency-injection/)\n\n  \nThank you very much for reading, and I really hope this information will help you achieve success in your career."

Your boss will probably say a bunch of terminology that will make absolutely no sense to you. This is the part where you need to ask a lot of questions. More than likely, your boss will not expect you to be a pro at understanding a big complicated system day one or even month one. Don't be afraid to say you don't know something. You will most likely feel very stressed these weeks when you feel like you know nothing.\n* Following on the above point, before working a dev job I never even *thought* about how much you really need to know about the field your code relates to. For example, my company makes insurance software. As a relatively fresh college grad, I basically know zero about insurance. And surprise surprise, you need to know what the hell you're doing in order to code it properly. So I've spent quite a good chunk of my time just trying to pick apart how insurance works and writing down insurance terminology.\n* **Know how to debug code.** This is probably the biggest skill I didn't really pay attention to before getting a job. Every professor just said \"know how to read other people's code,\" but that's really hard to quantify. Literally 99% of your tasks in a job, you will have to step through the code with the debugger to understand how it works before you make any changes. I had never even stepped through code before starting this job, because I was so used to my personal projects where I know everything about the code. When working with Visual Studio, you *will* use breakpoints, and you *will* add watches on variables. I seriously vastly underestimated how important debugging is.\n\nWhen coding projects on my free time, I liked to think of programming as closer to art. You're putting a lot of time and effort into creating something unique. It takes a lot of the same thought processes that go into drawing or designing. Should this go here? Can this be done better? I think this will work better.\n\nWhen coding at work, I think it's closer to detective work than art. You're not painting a beautiful app on your canvas, the app already exists. You're a problem solver. You're receiving tasks pointing you in the right direction of the issue, but it's your job to investigate and find the culprit. You're not creating, you're fixing and updating.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer\n\nEdit: words"

        "title": "Tools I wish I had known about when I started coding",
        "content": "Hey all! I had compiled this list about two years ago, shortly after I started programming, and I found that is was helpful to a lot of folks, so I wanted to resurrect it.\n\nWhile the way I do some things has changed a lot in the last couple of years, these all helped me a lot when I was just getting into web development, and hopefully they might help you too!\n\n## Chrome Extensions\n\nNow that I am a self-proclaimed web developer, I practically live in my Chrome console. Below are some tools that allow me to spend less time there:\n\n* [WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) — The name says it all. This is an easy way of finding out the fonts that your favorite website is using, so that you can borrow them for your own projects.\n* [Pesticide](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome/bblbgcheenepgnnajgfpiicnbbdmmooh?hl=en) — Useful for seeing the outlines of your HTML elements and modifying CSS. This was a lifesaver when I was trying to learn my way around the box-model.\n* [Colorzilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en) — Useful for copying exact colors off of a website. This copies a color straight to your clipboard so you don’t spend forever trying to get the right RGBA combination.\n* [CSS Peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk?hl=en) — Useful for looking at colors and assets used on a website. A good exercise, especially when starting out, is cloning out websites that you think look cool. This gives you a peek under the hood at their color scheme and allows you to see what other assets exist on their page.\n* [Wappalyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=en) — Useful for seeing the technologies being used on a website. Ever wonder what kind of framework a website is using or what service it is hosted on? Look no further.\n* [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) — Useful for debugging your React applications. It bears mentioning that this is only useful if you are programming a React application.\n* [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) — Useful for debugging applications using Redux. It bears mentioning that this is only useful if you are implementing Redux in your application.\n* [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) — Useful for making JSON look cleaner in the browser. Have you ever stared an ugly JSON blob in the face, trying to figure out how deeply nested the information you want is? Well this makes it so that it only takes 2 hours instead of 3.\n* [Vimeo Repeat and Speed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimeo-repeat-speed/noonakfaafcdaagngpjehilgegefdima?hl=en) — Useful for speeding up Vimeo videos. If you watch video tutorials like most web developers, you know how handy it is to consume them at 1.25 times the regular playback speed. There are also versions for YouTube.\n\n## VS Code Extensions\n\nVisual Studio Code is my editor of choice.\n\nPeople love their text editors, and I am no exception. However, I’m willing to bet most of these extensions work for whatever editor you are using as well. Check out my favorite extensions:\n\n* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) — Auto rename paired HTML tags. You created a <p> tag. Now you want to change it, as well as its enclosing </p> tag to something else. Simply change one and the other will follow. Theoretically improves your productivity by a factor of 2.\n* [HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css) — CSS support for HTML documents. This is useful for getting some neat syntax highlighting and code suggestions so that CSS only makes you want to quit coding a couple of times a day.\n* [HTML Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abusaidm.html-snippets) — Useful code snippets. Another nice time saver. Pair this with [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) and you barely ever have to type real HTML again.\n* [Babel ES6/ES7](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzannotti.vscode-babel-coloring) — Adds JavaScript Babel syntax coloring. If you are using Babel, this will make it much easier to differentiate what is going on in your code. This is neat if you like to play with modern features of JavaScript.\n* [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) — Adds colors to brackets for easier block visualization. This is handy for those all-too-common bugs where you didn’t close your brackets or parentheses accurately. EDIT: Version 2 now available [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)\n* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) — Integrates ESLint into Visual Studio Code. This is handy for getting hints about bugs as you are writing your code and, depending on your configuration, it can help enforce good coding style.\n* [Guides](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spywhere.guides) — Adds extra guide lines to code. This is another visual cue to make sure that you are closing your brackets correctly. If you can’t tell, I’m a very visual person.\n* [JavaScript Console Utils](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whtouche.vscode-js-console-utils) — Makes for easier console logging. If you are like most developers, you will find yourself logging to the console in your debugging flow (I know that we are supposed to use the debugger). This utility makes it easy to create useful console.log() statements.\n* [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) — Spelling checker that accounts for camelCase. Another common source of bugs is fat-thumbing a variable or function name. This spell checker will look for uncommon words and is good about accounting for the way we write things in JavaScript.\n* [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) — Makes it easier to see when, and by whom, changes were made. This is nice for blaming the appropriate person when code gets broken, since it is absolutely never your fault.\n* [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) — File path autocompletion. This is super handy for importing things from other files. It makes navigating your file tree a breeze.\n* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) — Automatic code formatter. Forget about the days where you had to manually indent your code and make things human-legible. Prettier will do this for you much faster, and better, than you ever could on your own. I can’t recommend this one enough.\n* [VSCode-Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons) — Adds icons to the file tree. If looking at your file structure hurts your eyes, this might help. There is a helpful icon for just about any kind of file you are making which will make it easier to distinguish what you are looking at.\n\nEDIT: found more tools I had compiled on a per operating system basis!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Operating System Agnostic\n\n[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) — At its most basic, this is an application that allows you to test the different endpoints of an API. You know, that good CRUD stuff. Once you dive deeper into it, you will find it is also incredibly useful for writing up test suites and much more.\n\n[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) — This is an open-source alternative to Postman. It appears to have a lot of the same functionality with a slightly lower price tag for their premium packages. Between this and Postman, the choice seems to mostly be personal preference for the UX. Don’t stay up all night making a decision between the two (I had to, forgive me).\n\n[Restlet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talend-api-tester-free-ed/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm?hl=en) — If you don’t want to download either of the above, this is an API testing client that is available as a Chrome extension. It even allows the importing of Postman tests and several other formats.\n\n[Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) — This is a sweet web debugging proxy that allows you to view all of the information you could possibly want to see about the requests being made between your machine and the internet. It basically turns you into a hacker, allowing you to check your website for security vulnerabilities and such.\n\n[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) — Basically the same tool as Charles. Personal preference seems to be the main deciding factor between the two, though both can greatly increase your debugging/troubleshooting capabilities.\n\n[Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) — If you’re reading this, chances are you probably spend a ton of time on your computer. Flux is a program that turns the blue light down on your screen as the sun sets, with the hopes of mimicking the day/night cycle and helping you sleep better. Not as good as getting time away from the screen, certainly, but it’s better than nothing!\n\n# Windows Specific\n\n[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) — If you are on Windows and you would like to have multiple terminal tabs, this is an easy, free solution to your tab-related woes. Never again will you have to flip back and forth through entire windows just to look at your different error messages.-\n\n[Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) — You know when you’re trying to copy four separate answers from Stack Overflow and you have to keep switching back and forth from your browser to your IDE? Worry no more. With the Ditto clipboard manager, you can copy-paste your way to victory.\n\n[TouchCursor](http://martin-stone.github.io/touchcursor/) — Programmers of all sorts are notorious for wanting to use the mouse as little as possible. If you find yourself in that camp, then this will be right up your alley\n\n[Cmder](https://cmder.net/) — I am going to forego my description of this product, as I feel the description on their website is much better — “Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.” I don’t know about you, but I am a fan of any software that describes itself as “sexy”\n\n[Directory Opus](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/) — This is basically what Windows Explorer should have been from the start. Opus allows you to dig through your poorly-organized documents almost as if they were well-organized.\n\n[Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) — With over 200 documentation sets to search through, Zeal is an offline goldmine of documentation for the developer who loves to read documentation so much that they do it even when the internet is out. (Copy-pasted from Dash in the Mac section).\n\n# Mac Specific\n\n[Paw](https://paw.cloud/) — A competitor to both Postman and Insomnia above, Paw is a similar piece of software that feels more like a native Mac application than the others. If you love that Mac feel, this might be the API tool for you.\n\n[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) — With over 200 documentation sets to search through, Dash is an offline goldmine of documentation for the developer who loves to read documentation so much that they do it even when the internet is out.\n\n[Bear](https://bear.app/) — Not directly coding related, but a neat piece of software for taking notes if that is something you do in your day-to-day. I can’t help but wish that this would be integrated with Paw somehow, for pun-related purposes.\n\n[Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) — Okay. Fair warning: This one costs money. If you can afford to dish up the 99 cents, however, I think it is worth it for those tough times when you don’t have access to a second monitor. This tool allows you to easily snap different windows to separate areas of your screen so you can run multiple terminals at once and tell your mom you are a hacker. (They are not paying me for this recommendation, sadly. However, if you are the creator of Magnet and you wish to pay me, please get in touch).\n\nEDIT 2: adding new version of Bracket Pair colorizer here and to description above [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)  \n\n\nEDIT 3: I've had people in dms asking about more advice/tooling. I'll definitely continue to cross post anything that makes sense to here like this post. I also try to help out on [https://twitter.com/marioahoyos](https://twitter.com/marioahoyos) . I am a career switcher like many people here are and I want to help as many people make the transition as I can :) "

        "content": "Hi everyone, having worked in the web scraping industry for a few years I know how easily troublesome it can be to write, maintain and even begin web scraping.\n\nOne year ago, I wrote a web-scraping guide that was really loved by the community. [reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/cqa5ed/a_webscraping_guide_for_beginners/), [article](https://www.daolf.com/posts/avoiding-being-blocked-while-scraping-ultimate-guide/). It was actually my first and only gilded post here 😊.\n\nOne year forward, I left my job and co-bootstrapped a web scraping API 🤞. During the year we have made some good tutorials for beginners on our blog and I wanted to share it with you. \n\nWe tried our best to make those tutorials complete (20 minutes read time each) and simple. They cover many topics related to web scraping from bottom to top.\n\n* how to make HTTP requests\n* how to parse HTML\n* how to use Chrome headless\n\nand much more.\n\nSo far we have written extensive guides for 5 languages:\n\n* [🐍 Python](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-101-with-python/)\n* [💎 Ruby](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-ruby/)\n* [😎 NodeJS](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-javascript/)\n* [🤓 R](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-r/)\n* [☕️ Java (130 pages free-ebook)](https://www.scrapingbee.com/java-webscraping-book/)\n\nHoping that it can help you with your work or your project.\n\nHappy to answer web scraping questions if you have any."

And trying to implement the optimization. I did two projects this way and it was extremely rewarding.\n\nTrying to force yourself to do something you don't like is a quick way to lose interest in this field and burn out."

        "title": "I wrote a syllabus for learning Python and Django. Four people have gone through it, two are interviewing and one got a job. It's based on using a somewhat even mix of coding challenges, personal projects and books.",
        "content": "[Syllabus](https://www.notion.so/4f0d76b4b6b54c88a4c99d665018bb66?v=a4f27ffcbe0a4776b796eed1eb1bb366)\n\nI've helped a few people become software engineers. The ones that learned the fastest used a mix of studying, coding challenges and personal projects. When you do all three of these things, they amplify each other. It also keeps you out of [tutorial hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i0kld3/how_students_get_themselves_into_tutorial_hell/).\n\nStudying (tutorials/videos/books) are how you learn about new topics and get exposed to good code. Coding challenges give you small problems to implement what you've learned and compare your solutions to other people's. Projects let you put it all together and give you something to show off when you're done.\n\nI put together my favorite resources and then iterated on it by mentoring a few people through it. It seems to be working well. The syllabus is free and all of the books together would total up to a few hundred dollars (money very well spent IMO).\n\nIt's set up in Notion as a non-linear path. You can copy the syllabus and then mark your progress as you go. You should have 2 or 3 things that are available to work on most of the time.\n\nIt's based on my own experience of learning to code. I've taken my favorite study materials and put them in somewhat logical order. By the end of it, you will be able to make basic web applications in Django.\n\nYou won't have just created one web app following a tutorial. That can be done from no experience in a weekend. You will have built up enough knowledge to do it on your own. There is hundreds of hours of work in this syllabus.\n\nThe beginning is probably a bit fast-paced if you are absolutely new to programming. Give yourself some more time to practice. If you want a *really* good foundation, check out Harvard's free online course, CS50.\n\n#### Focus\n\nThe first focus is on Python. Python is one of the most popular languages. It's used across many different fields (scripting, web apps, ML, data). It's also one of the easiest languages for beginners. This combination makes it a great first language.\n\nThe second focus is on making web apps in Django. Django is a web framework written in Python. Django isn't introduced until more than halfway through the tutorial. \n\nIf the goal was just to display web pages, that could be done much sooner. But the goal here is to make real programs and let people interact with them over the internet. A strong foundation in Python is essential for that.\n\n#### Then what?\n\nThis syllabus is light on frontend work. If you want to focus on that, you could switch over to JavaScript when you're done. Your time with Python won't have been wasted.\n\nIf you want to stay on backend development, you can just keep making more projects. You could also learn how to make web APIs, maybe with Django Rest Framework.\n\nYou could stop on web apps all together and go to some other domain. Python is probably used there. If you already know that's what you want do, this may not be the syllabus for you. You could at least work until Django shows up and then stop.\n\n#### How to use the Syllabus\n\n1. Go to the [Syllabus page](https://www.notion.so/4f0d76b4b6b54c88a4c99d665018bb66).\n2. Duplicate it (there's a link in the top right).\n3. Pick an assignment with a green check mark next to it.\n4. Click on the assignment to see the notes and URL.\n5. Do the assignment.\n6. Check off the \"Finished\" box.\n7. Pick a new assignment with a green check mark and repeat.\n8. Refer back to the original Syllabus to see any changes\n9. When you get stuck, unstick yourself.\n\n#### When you don't know how to do something\n\n1. Read the documentation\n2. Search\n    1. Google\n    2. Stack Overflow\n3. Post\n    1. Stack Overflow\n    2. Subreddits\n\n#### FAQ\n\nDo you have this for X?\n\nCheck out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for a version of JavaScript, optionally with Ruby. I don't know any others well enough to recommend.\n\nHow long will it take?\n\nTwo people going full time finished it in a little over three months.\n\n#### Syllabus\n\nDuplicate it [on Notion](https://www.notion.so/4f0d76b4b6b54c88a4c99d665018bb66?v=a4f27ffcbe0a4776b796eed1eb1bb366) if you want tracking.\n\n[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)  \nSkip sections 14 and 15.  \n\n[CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware And Software](https://amzn.to/2YjGCTR)  \n\n[HackerRank: 30 Easy](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bdifficulty%5D%5B%5D=easy)  \nNever spend more than 10 minutes stuck on a problem!

        "title": "I've reviewed thousands of applications for university recruiting at a startup. Here’s a bit of what I look for when reviewing an application. (Part 2)",
        "content": "I've been a hiring manager for a US-based university recruiting at my unicorn of a few hundred people. As a follow up to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/inrex1/ive_reviewed_thousands_of_applications_for/), I thought I’d share a bit about how I go about reviewing applications. Also, if you aren’t aware of the [Resume FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_resumes), this is a really amazing resource and I would check that out first. My post here represents one specific viewpoint whereas that advice is more broad and generic.\n\n*Edit:* **One thing to note is my experience is only in the context of a Unicorn (which is competitive with FAANG). In our case we have tens of thousands of applications but we only have the capacity to interview a couple hundred.**\n\nHere’s a bit of the behind the scenes for how I review applications:\n\n* Frankly, application review is not my full time job, so usually I end up doing this after work hours. Typically I might spend 30-60 minutes reviewing applications before decision fatigue sets in.\n* Most applications would be pretty clear after about 5 seconds of reviewing. Probably 5% would be an obvious yes and 75% would be an obvious no.\n* The other 20% of the cases take up 90% of the time. If your applications is in that 20%, then I’ll take some more time to look through all the details. If you provide links like personal websites or Github, I'll probably click into that.\n\nWhen reviewing a resume, here is the rough order of things I’ll look for:\n\n* *Industry Experience.* Having an internship at Facebook, Google, or another highly prestigious company on your resume probably makes you a yes most of the time. Otherwise I'd look into the details of what you did in your various roles. If you had an internship where you just pushed code around, that doesn't show much. But if you had an internship where you built and ~~shipped something that was used by a million users, or halved the latency of all requests~~ solved a really challenging but really impactful problem, then that's probably an automatic yes. Because of this, I’ve often preferred candidates who interned at startups and were forced to play an impactful role in the company over candidates who joined a less tech focused F500 company.\n* *University.* I’ll be the first to admit that I’m ashamed at how high this is. There are a number of reasons that which university should not be this high: (1) it is highly correlated to how well off your family is, (2) it only reflects on what you accomplished in high school and ignores what you accomplished in college. Unfortunately, university rankings are still the most reliable standardization out there. There is still a correlation between where your university and your success in interviews and your success in industry. If you go to a top 5 CS school, you’re a bit more likely to be a yes than a no if everything else on your resume looks solid. Granted, if you're at MIT but you haven't shown much else in any of the other categories, then you’re still going to find yourself to be a no in most cases.\n* *Teaching Experience.* I've found that being a TA is one of the signals that helps separate soft skills the most. I appreciate candidates who have deep knowledge of a topic, can empathize with where someone else might be coming from in their understanding, and bridge that gap. If you haven’t done so already, **I highly recommend talking with your professor about becoming a TA.**\n* *Projects.* There's a ton of nuance in projects listed, so I’ll go into more detail.\n   * School project in your introductory CS sequence - this doesn't show me anything that would separate you from everyone else.\n   * Hackathon(or similar) project - This shows me you probably have a genuine interest in learning new technology and building software. Also in this category are clones of apps.\n   * Research project / Project teams - This shows me that you take initiative to dive deep into academic areas that interest you. It’s even better if the research project requires you to work with a team.\n   * Open Source Project - There's a ton of nuance here, but if you're making contributions to a critical library or if you decided to build something from scratch and it has some traction, that looks awesome.\n   * Productionized application solving a real world problem that has real users - I would love to get you an interview ASAP. You don’t need revenue, funding, or even a startup, but there is no shortage of real world problems where software can help. If you can honestly say you’ve dedicated a significant chunk of time to this, feel free to put it on your work experience too. The best part of this is that unlike internships of university, this is 100% in your control. I cannot stress this enough - **show me that you can solve a real world problem with software and have real people use what you built.**\n* *Coursework.* Computer science is still the gold standard in software engineering, but you can still succeed without a CS degree as long as you show that you’re not shying away from project heavy classes and still understand basic CS theory. I generally like candidates who are taking more advanced courses (like grad level classes) and/or more programming heavy courses (like compilers or operating systems).\n* *Extracurriculars.* Candidates that take initiative and can handle large amounts of responsibility are great. In addition to displaying leadership, extracurriculars also show me how you are striving for excellence in the things that you enjoy doing. Show me your passion for sports, dance, theatre, or whatever and the things that you've done to push yourself in those areas.\n* *Degree.* BS vs BA doesn’t make a difference. Having a Masters is a slight bump, but if you can get your Bachelors + Masters degrees in 4 or 4.5 years, then that’s pretty impressive.\n* *GPA.* Honestly, GPA doesn’t really matter too much. If you leave it off your resume, I’ll probably just assume it’s lower than a 3.0, but that also probably wouldn’t be a dealbreaker. If it’s really good, that would be a slight bump. However, I’ve seen people with a 4.0 that fail in industry roles where soft skills and the ability to handle ambiguity are important.\n* *Skills.* I wouldn’t care too much if you included this. When hiring new grads we don’t hire for the programming languages they know or don’t know. However, if you have experience with iOS and you’re applying to a company with a big mobile presence, maybe you should put it on your resume.\n* *Cover Letter.* I almost never look at the cover letter.\n* *Work Authorization.* We don’t have a team capable of handling immigration for more than a handful of people, usually reserved for leadership and extremely senior positions. If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, it would be beneficial to add it.\n\nGeneral advice:\n\n* Less can be more. I’m browsing through applications quickly, so be sure that any key words or accomplishments don’t get missed because your resume is too cluttered. Imagine that my eyes are jumping around the page, looking for key phrases. If you’re describing your previous internship, instead of describing what you did week by week, find 1 bullet point that encapsulates the work you did the entire summer. Then add 2-3 additional ones describing the most impactful or most challenging parts that made up that project. And please make sure your resume fits on one page - I sometimes don’t even think to scroll down when reviewing a resume.\n* When going into the details of your work, avoid jargon that the average technical recruiter wouldn’t know. There is a fine art in communicating accomplishments without going into too much detail, but it helps to imagine yourself explaining it out loud to a friend.\n* Show me the impact of your work. In general, software engineers are responsible for solving real world problems with code. I know that it can be tempting to talk about the technical details of what you did, but be sure to show the impact that it had.\n\nKeep in mind that this post just reflects my thoughts and there are plenty of other companies and other people that review applications that are looking for different things. Please don't overfit your application to one single narrow viewpoint. If you’re in a role that also reviews applications, I’d love to hear your thoughts as well. Let me know your thoughts and if there's any other topic you'd like to learn more about."

        "title": "I've reviewed thousands of applications for university recruiting at a startup. Here are some numbers and thoughts on the university recruiting process.",
        "content": "I've been a hiring manager for a US-based university recruiting at my unicorn of a few hundred people.\n\nHere are some numbers and thoughts to paint a picture of what it's like being on the recruiting side:\n\n* We are still pretty small, so we can only support about a **dozen new grad** and a **dozen intern roles**. This role was split between me as the hiring manager and one recruiter.\n* Despite that, we would receive **hundreds of applications per day**. I think over the course of last fall's recruiting cycle, we had over 15,000 applications. We aren't even a household name or anything. When I went to a career fair, \\~90% of the students had never heard of us.\n* Because we have so many applications for such few roles, we are only able to extend offers to **\\~0.3%** applications.\n* Diversity is really important from the tops down and personally I 100% agree. We saw from random sampling that **40% of all applications were female**. We were always expected to match or beat that %. Granted we also invested in trying to find more women, so I’m not sure if the % will be as high for other companies.\n* It was impossible to review every single application. My partner and I would try our best to review applications, but often this work would happen after work hours because the volume would be way too high. Even if we were able to review applications fast enough, we sometimes would see bottlenecks with the number of interviewers available or toward the outstanding headcount remaining. We would either have to bulk reject candidates without reviewing them or leave them ghosted. **If you were ghosted or if you were rejected even though you thought your resume was good enough, I'm sorry.**\n* Because of the bottlenecks, in order to have the best shot of having someone review your application, you should always **apply as early as possible**.\n* We have multiple locations across the US and the ones outside of the SF Bay Area were always harder to fill. If you're struggling to find a job in the Bay Area it might be helpful to also apply to other places.\n* I have strong feelings about coding interviews. I hate interviews that require you to find some kind of brain teaser element or require dynamic programming to solve. We discourage our interviewers from asking those kinds of questions. But we do need to find ways to find candidates that are fluent with solving complex problems with code.\n* The passthrough rate is a really key number for high volume recruiting. In addition to obvious tradeoffs between quality of candidates you extender offers to, if the passthrough rate is too high, then it limits the number of people you can extend initial interviews to in the first place. If the passthrough rate is too low, then you're spending too many interviewing hours. Given that we have limited headcount, but we want to give as many people a chance as possible, we will have about a **50% passthrough rate on each round of interviews**.\n\nI'm not sharing this to boast about any acceptance rate numbers or to put anyone down who doesn't think they'd make the cut, but just to share a single viewpoint of what things are like on the other side. Also note that this is a super narrow viewpoint, I don't know what things are like at large companies or non-tech focused companies.\n\nI know that things are rough out there and I wish that everyone that wanted to get into software engineering could get the opportunity. I hope that some people found this helpful and if there's demand for it I can also share details of what I look for when reviewing an application.\n\nBest of luck out there."

They figured out that making you have to dig instead of giving everything in a neat timeline affects you psychologically in a way that makes you use Facebook more, so they kept doing it and kept tweaking that algorithm. Then endless scrolling and touch screens come along, so they continue to optimize for \"engagement\" (literally algorithms rearranging what you see in order to keep you looking at the screen longer) and then we've been raising children in this environment and shaping their brains with this skinner box minefield.

C'est donc avec beaucoup de fierté que je vous présente aujourd'hui le fruit de mes observations. Je les appelle sobrement \"Petit manuel d'antidémocratie: trucs et astuces pour museler l'opposition\".  \n>  \n>J'ai décidé de vous rendre service : à chacun de nos désaccords, il vous suffira de revoir mon intervention et de piocher dans les astuces suivantes.  \n>  \n>Astuce numéro un : discuter des  pesticides la nuit toujours en catimini. C'est avec cette méthode que vous aviez refusé l'interdiction du glyphosate par un vote à 4h30 du matin un vendredi soir au moment où l'hémicycle était désert. Après tout pourquoi attendre qu'une grande partie des parlementaires soit dans l'hémicycle pour légiférer sur des sujets d les délicats ? C'est aussi ce qui s'est passé hier soir avec la discussion sur les pesticides tueurs d'abeilles qui s'est prolongée jusqu'à 2h30 du matin.  \n>  \n>Astuce numéro 2 : faire passer directement les éléments de langage ou des âmes au nom du gouvernement aux députés de la majorité. Vous avez raison, on n'est jamais mieux servi que par soi-même. Il suffit pour le gouvernement d'envoyer aux députés la république en marche des questions qui font de préférence les louanges de leur politique ou bien des amendements qui vont dans leur sens. Mais attention collègues députés, pensez bien à changer l'exposé des motifs au risque de paraître un peu ridicule.  \n>  \n>Astuce numéro 3 : demander un second vote quand on n'est pas d'accord avec le premier. C'était votre technique encore la semaine dernière. L'assemblée avait rejeté un recul de la démocratie environnementale le mercredi, nouveau vote le vendredi. L'avantage de cette astuce, c'est que le simple fait de demander un second vote fait comprendre aux députés de la majorité que le premier n'était pas le bon. C'est finalement ce que nous faisons encore aujourd'hui pour les néonicotinoïdes interdits en 2016 pour leur dangerosité peut-être trop réautorisés de nouveau quatre ans après.  \n>  \n>Astuce numéro 4 : mentir tout simplement. Annoncer la fin du glyphosate, mais refuser tous les amendements qui demandent son interdiction. Dites que vous allez reprendre sans filtre les propositions de la convention citoyenne pour le climat, mais enterrer les propositions qui nuisent le plus au bon fonctionnement du libéralisme ou sinon proclamer haut et fort que vous êtes contre les néonicotinoïdes, mais votez pour les néonicotinoïdes.  \n>  \n>Astuces numéro 5 : faire diversion dès que possible. Asutuce à utiliser sans modération : avoir Greta Thunberg comme invités le jour du vote du traité de libre-échange du CETA où pendant que le vivant s'effondre et que le dérèglement climatique avance, parler des nombrils des jeunes filles, de séparatisme ou encore - gagnant à tous les coups - des musulmans.  \n>  \n>Astuce numéro 6 : vous faire passer pour des pragmatiques. Celle-là c'est votre préféré vous l'avez copieusement utilisé pendant l'examen de cette loi. Il vous suffit de repeindre l'opposition en rêveur en irresponsables qui traînent des propos d'estrade pour faire de vous les réalistes, les terre à terre qui prennent des décisions rationnelles. Ne dites surtout pas \"nous avons écouté les lobbys\" mes préférez \"nous sommes contraints de faire ce que nous faisons en vertu du principe de réalité\". Employez un sophisme classique : \"si l'opposition est contre la réautorisation des néonicotinoïdes, c'est qu'elle est pour la fin de l'industrie sucrière en France et pour la mise à mort des producteurs de betteraves\" en sommes au-delà de l'arrêt autorisation de ces pesticides point de salut. Votre pensée complexe va même plus loin en fait ce qu'il faut c'est être contre les néonicotinoïdes, mais pour le texte qu’ils réautorisent. Il ne faut pas hésiter à dire que \"ce texte marque la fin de l'utilisation des pesticides tueurs d'abeilles\" alors qu'il les réintroduit.  \n>  \n>Vous me suivez ? Bon j'ai bien peur que ces manuels et ses astuces aussi utiles soit elles n'éclipsent pas totalement la réalité de ce que vous êtes en train de faire et, monsieur le ministre, vos arguments d'autorité n'y changeront rien.  \n>  \n>Oui nous avons bien compris que vous avez un diplôme d'ingénieur des eaux et forêts, mais comme le disait madame la ministre Pompili qui a brillé par son absence pendant de nos débats comme elle le disait en 2016 lors du vote pour interdire les néonicotinoïdes : \"nous ne pourrons pas dire que nous ne savions pas\". Oui nous savons oui, vous savez. 20 ans d'études scientifiques prouvent la dangerosité des néonicotinoïdes sur les abeilles, sur les sols, l'eau la biodiversité et notre santé humaine, et ce pour des dizaines d'années. Nous savons que 80 % des insectes européens ont déjà disparu en 30 ans. Nous savons que sans pollinisateurs 85 % des cultures sont en danger, soit toute notre souveraineté alimentaire. Nous savons que ce vote engage la place internationale de la France qui avait eu une politique exemplaire d'interdiction de ce poison. Nous savons que ce texte entraînerait des effets sur les générations futures, surtout sur le développement du cerveau des enfants. Oui nous savons et nous pouvons faire autrement. Il faut d'urgence planifier la bifurcation vers une agriculture paysanne et écologique.  \n>  \n>Nous voterons contre ce texte, car cette loi est un empoisonnement volontaire et si elle devait passer nous ferons un signalement devant la cour de justice de la république pour mise en danger de la vie d'autrui en connaissance de cause. Collègues voter en conscience soyons à la hauteur des enjeux de notre siècle notre refus peut changer l'histoire."

I've completely shifted my focus from ML/AI to Data Infrastructure and although the latter is less flashy, the work is also much more fun.  \n\n\nFrom my experience, a lot of ML work was about 75% Data Curation, about 5% building pipelines and designing systems, and about 20% tuning parameters to get better results. Imagine someone gave you a massive 10 GB excel sheet, and your job is to use the data to predict sales; the vast majority of your work is going to be trimming the data and documenting it, not actually building the model.  \n\n\nObviously this is only based on my opinion (you might have a much different experience). But as someone who has worked in multiple subfields including ML, infrastructure, embedded, I can very honestly say ML was my least favorite, while infrastructure was the most fun. The whole point of data infrastructure is to build systems, classes, and pipelines to maximize efficiency... so you're actually engineering things the whole day at work.  \n\n\nBut if you want a cool job to brag about at parties, then \"I work on artificial intelligence\" is basically unbeatable.\n\nEdit : Clearly this is a popular opinion"

The term \"machine learning\" is just a form of branding, as the word \"learning\" implies *intelligence*, which computers presently *do not* have.\n\nThat said, it's disingenuous to equate AI with machine learning. This is because AI is really more about the *application* than the *method*. Cutting edge natural language processing is currently done via statistical models. But natural language processing is so much more than statistics. Robotics is a combination of control theory & computer vision, both of which are built on top of statistical models; but that doesn't stop it from being genuinely \"cool.\"\n\nThe trouble with machine learning - or applied statistics as I prefer to think of it - in industry is that it's typically employed for boring problems with boring solutions, like targeted advertisement or retail analytics. Don't blame the method - blame the application."

Offer to help them write resumes, maybe even practice interviews or help them fill out applications. \n- Know someone who lost a love one? Offer a listening ear, or to go for a walk to take their mind off things. \n- Someone displaced from their home? Maybe you have space to temporarily store some items, a truck to help move, some things collecting in the garage that may be of use to them when they are able to find a place. Maybe you can temporarily watch their pet. Your friend may not have these things on their radar.\n\nBasically, think of the situation and what their needs are. Think of what you can do to help, and of course won't place too much of an emotional or financial drain on you. Your friend/loved one may be too overwhelmed to know WHAT they need, or not know what you are realistically able to offer. Letting them know what you specifically are able to help with will provide tangible options in a stressful time.

        "content": "I don't know if you've seen [this video](https://youtu.be/-YnMr1lj4Z8) yet, but it was super helpful for me to learn the basic ins and outs of how Docker works at a technical level.\n\nContainers on Linux are like separate environments for your programs to run on. You can think of them as one level up from virtual machines; instead of being entirely separate OSes, they're instead separated environments of the same OS your host is running on. From each container's perspective, the network interfaces, processes, mounted volumes/filesystems, etc are *all that exist*; no processes from the host or from other containers are visible, as they're all in separate \"namespaces.\" From the host's perspective, everything is visible, because the host is the one doing all the behind-the-scenes mapping from the so-called \"namespaced\" identifiers for processes, network interfaces, etc to the actual underlying structures on the host.\n\nDocker itself is a tool to manage these containers. It takes care of creating these separate environments for you (well, technically it shells out to other software), and handles managing all of these isolated namespaces as one unit, the \"container.\" It also handles connecting multiple containers together by way of creating magic network devices which only link the containers they're connected to together. Additionally, it handles the filesystems of these isolated environments through images, temporary storage created alongside the container, bind mounts, and volumes.\n\nA Docker image is the template from which a container is constructed. It encompasses a filesystem layout, a default \"entrypoint\" (the first program to be executed), a default \"command\" (the arguments to be passed to that first program), and some other metadata about the image. Images are used as read-only bases for containers to run off of; because they're read-only, they can be shared by several containers without having to duplicate the data on disk. Notably, containers generally encompass an entire Linux system's filesystem, since the nature of a container is to isolate everything from the host, including system state and installed libraries; if an image is missing a shared library object, even if it exists on the host, a program that needs that shared library will not run."

        "content": "Today I completed the below 4 certificates on freecodecamp.com, I was able to do them( about 650 lessons ) in about 3 months ( by giving 1 hr each on weekday and 2-3 hrs on weekends, though I wasn't regular always )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to my profile in case wanna see my heat map, I have tried to be as regular as I can](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ashish2199)\n\n\\- [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ashish2199/responsive-web-design)\n\n\\- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ashish2199/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)\n\n\\- [Front End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ashish2199/front-end-libraries)\n\n\\- [APIs and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ashish2199/apis-and-microservices)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Below is my experience and things I learnt**\n\nEven though I am not a beginner, I have worked in Java ecosystem creating web applications.\n\nBut I was quite new to JS, in past I had only used simple JS statements like document.getElementById('').value to get values of fields in form and making a AJAX call to some API using them. Before this, I had worked on my company's own JS framework where we had all scaffolding and everything laid out to us so that developer didn't need to interact with low level stuff themselves.\n\nIn short I didn't know how to build things from scratch myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Responsive Web Design**\n\n>Topics learnt - Basic HTML, CSS, CSS grid, CSS flexbox, Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility courses\n\nI knew lot of stuff from this learning path(basic HTML and CSS).\n\nWhat I found helpful was Applied Visual Design and Applied Accessibility courses. They are important for making sites that is accessible by everyone. Being a good programmer is not just about making stuff for ideal condition. Things we make should be resilient enough so that they work in non ideal conditions and user still able to use our application.\nI also liked learning about color theory, how to choose colors for your website, how much contrast you should have between your text and background for readability. \n\nI learnt CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox.\nFirstly I did a course on [Scrimba.com Learn Flexbox](https://scrimba.com/learn/flexbox) This helped me understand basic syntax. Its easier to start with someone explaining the concept to you than you just reading a bunch of text. Next thing I did was I went through [CSS-Tricks.com A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) I went through each CSS property and filled in the missing gaps which the above tutorial didn't cover.\n\nI followed similar approach for CSS grid i.e. first watched videos on [Learn CSS Grid](https://scrimba.com/learn/R8PTE) and then read [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)\n\nThe projects at the end of the path were fun to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**\n\n>Topics Learnt - Basic JavaScript, ES6 syntax, Regular Expression, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming and debugging\n\nI was really looking forward to this topics as it had all the real world programming stuff. I knew basic JS with few gaps here and there. I didn't knew much about object oriented programming in JS other than creating basic objects through object literal and assigning values to their properties and using them as place to store things.\n\nEven though ES6 was released almost 5 years back, still all these syntax were new to me. I learnt many things like arrow functions, default parameters, let vs const vs var,  Destructuring Assignment , rest and spread operators, class syntax.\n\nFunctional programming especially the array methods taught me how to do things concisely and without changing the array we are working on. It feels good to accomplish things with so less code after using them.It taught me how Functional programming taught me to reduce bugs by making predictable pure functions by avoiding the change of input arguments and making functions that don't have side effect(don't change other variables/properties that are outside your function).\n\nThe problem solving challenges were not too tough and I was able to solve most of them without any difficulty. These lessons wouldn't teach you Data Structures and Algorithms required for cracking interviews(better use [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) or [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) for that) but the everyday problem solving skills.( These tutorials are meant for beginners to start building things and not to do bog them down by teaching theoretical stuff first )\n\nI didn't use any other tutorial for this path as it itself was so big. Though I would like to go through [JS MDN guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) in future to cover my knowledge gaps.\n\nThings I would want to study more - Asynchronous Programming ( promise, async, await ), learn more about the tricky stuff like closure and JavaScript idiosyncrasies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Front End Libraries**\n\n>Topics learnt - Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React, Redux\n\nI had completed the courses for Bootstrap and jQuery in 2018. I just went through my notes once in order to review them.\n\nI was excited to learn React and was amazed by how some of the things are so simple to do. I learnt about JSX, two types of components - stateless functional components and class components, how to use props, how to communicate between child and parent component.\n\nI feel I have gaps in my knowledge, these tutorials are good to give you a introduction but if you wanna build real world stuff you need to dig deeper by [going through React official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).\n\nStill they have provided me enough knowledge for me to know where to look for what things and be able to understand official docs. Its about learning how to learn :D instead of learning that specific thing.\n\nI built all my projects in React in order to improve my react knowledge. Some of the projects like 25 + 5 clock timer were really tough to get their tests right as there always off by 1 error. ( But we learn only from the tough things :p )\n\nI would like to share few projects that we were required to make in order to get this certification(all of them were very interesting functionality wise as well).\n\n* [Pomodoro Timer](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW)\n* [JS Calculator](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX)\n* [Drum music playing machine](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/MJyNMd)\n* [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**APIs and Microservices**\n\n>Topics learnt - NPM, Basic Node and Express, Mongoose\n\nI was finally was able to create my much hyped REST APIs :P\n\nI discovered that I do not need to install anything on my laptop and I could code everything online. I was using [repl.it](http://repl.it/) as my online IDE and used [MongoDB cloud atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for my database. I really enjoyed being able to host my projects online without much effort.\n\nThis didn't cover much about Node.js and I am planning to learn it own through their [official documentation](https://nodejs.dev/learn).\n\nI went through [ExpressJS Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/index.htm) to get better understanding of Express.\n\nThe tutorials didn't cover a lot of things which is kind of expected if you have reached so far, you should be able to [Read, Search, (Don’t Be Afraid to) Ask](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/read-search-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-743a23c411b4/) on your own.\n\nI enjoyed doing the projects especially the URL shortner( it feels good to bieng able to make something that could be useful in real life).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also plan to do Quality Assurance Certification to learn more about unit testing and some more Node.js\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I would like to share my notes which I created while going through the courses on below topics.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16U2sWNtjb8n4xKnyRssThWBNEtsRC4aH?usp=sharing)\n\n    Responsive Web Design Certification:\n    - HTML5.txt\n    - CSS.txt\n    - Responsive Web Design Principles.txt\n    - Applied Accessibility.txt   \n    - Applied Visual Design.txt   \n    - CSS Grid.txt   \n    \n    Javascript Alogrithms and Data Structures Certification:\n    - Baisc Javascript FreeCodeCamp.txt\n    - ES6.txt\n    - Object Oriented Programming.txt\n    - Regular Expressions.txt\n    - Debugging.txt\n    - Functional Programming.txt\n    - Basic Data Structures.txt\n    - Basic Algorithm Scripting.txt\n    \n    Forent End Libraries Certification:\n    - Bootstrap.txt\n    - jQuerry.txt \n    - Sass.txt\n    - React.txt              \n    - Redux.txt     \n    - React and Redux.txt   \n     \n    API and Microservices Certification:\n    - Managing Packaged with NPM.txt\n    - Basic Node and Express.txt\n    - MongoDB and Mongoose Challenges.txt     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings that are important in real world but are not covered:\n\n* How to write clean code - how to divide your code into small logical functions , how to write good variable names and functions names that convey what they are doing\n* How to debug using chrome dev tools : [Google Chrome Developer Tools Crash Course Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4q86IjJFag)\n* How to navigate and perform basic file operations in Linux\n* Version Control : Git\n* How to document your code, how to follow syntax and other common practices\n* How to create models/solutions for real world/abstract problem domains\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am planning to go through the things mentioned in below sites and fill my knowledge gaps. They provide a good checklist of things we should know as a front end developer.\n\n\\- JS Interview Checklist ([https://js-interview.com/javascript-interview-preparation-checklist/](https://js-interview.com/javascript-interview-preparation-checklist/))\n\n\\- Front End developer Roadmap ([https://roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend))\n\n\\- React Roadmap ([https://roadmap.sh/react](https://roadmap.sh/react))\n\nI would want to dig deeper into react by going through the official documentation, go through Node.js official documentation and probable learn GraphQL (an alternative to REST API)\n\n**Though all this seems to be an ambitious plan :)**"

It's encrypted on your device and they never have access to it. The government can't force them to turn it over since they don't have access to it, and they also can't directly compel the company to change how the site works so they can get it.\n\nThis bill sidesteps that by forcing companies to build in ways to access their users data, or open them up to being sued by anyone for content the site hosts. Which would be a death sentence.\n\nAll in the guise of \"protecting children\"."

Pretty much every book I attempted to have sent to me was denied because they thought I was attempting to hack their computers or escape somehow.\n\nIn the end, my wife had to resort to buying books and swapping out the cover for gangster fiction novels which they had no problems with me receiving. In the last year of my sentence I got sent to a minimum security prison that allowed me to get all of the books sent in that I wanted.\n\nThe crazy thing is that those books got me through my time, programming change my life, and those four years of non stop learning was like college in some weird way for me. Coming home and being able to devour information with no constraints was something that really felt like another level of liberation for me.\n\nNot many people who were incarcerated with me got why I spent all my days in the books the way I did, I still have a notebook with all the programs that I wrote by hand in it (most of them in scala btw) but I was just trying to make sure I’d never have to come back. The fact that I got the knowledge that I have now under those circumstances makes it mean that much more to me now. Sad they they try to prevent you from learning inside the system, but where there is a will there is a way.\n\nSorry for the long post, but this just brought back some feelings/memories for me. Prayers for all those incarcerated trying to change their lives for the better despite the odds."

Study for 15 minutes. A 40 is much better than a 0.\nDon't feel like working out today? Go for a walk.\nToo busy for breakfast? Drink a cup of milk.\nStayed up too late? Go to bed right now. 3 hours of sleep is superior to none.\nThe pile of dirty dishes too daunting? Wash 5.\nCan't do the whole yard? Mow the front.\n\nThe principle can be applied to various situations in life. Often times you may find that after you get started, you feel motivated to complete the task, but if not, hey...you did part of it, and that's nothing to sneeze at (and it's certainly better than nothing.)\n\nY'all take care of yourselves"

Not only will it force you to read and google to figure things out, you will have mostly built your own portfolio with dozens of projects once you finish their curriculum. \n\nIf I had to start all over again, that will be the route I'm going to take and maybe do some freecodecamp on the side.\n\nGood luck!"

        "content": "Okay, my initial comment was kind of to be funny and get upvotes, but I'm going to be real here, because I think this is more important than internet points.\n\nThis is basically the same. There is the difference of Black vs Jew, but the core is the same.\n\nThe event you are describing in 2001 after 9/11 is that Fox started claiming to be the only \"fair and balanced\" source of news, but they weren't. They were preaching hate because it sold things better during commercials. They know their ratings, they know what sells, they know their audience because they made their audience. Every year they got bolder and more blatand with their lies because they didn't have to be honest during their \"entertainment\" shows, only during the actual \"news\" (10pm I think). They kept winning in court when challenged because \"free speech\". The most infuriating part is that free speech means you can share unpopular opinions without retribution. Ouright lying is actually not covered under free speech.\n\nWhen Obama started running, they made shit up. Not because he was black, but because he was a Democrat. Him being black just allowed the audience to believe it, because intuitively, black people are \"drug addicts\" that you see on \"Cops\". That show did so much more harm than good, despite the best of intentions. When Obama became president anyway, they made shit up to justify their inaccurate statements.\n\nMaking shit up worked to rile people up even if it was a direct contradiction of what was said the week prior. Angry people have short memories. Harboring anger actually inhibits your ability to think rationally. It's a psychological phenomenon. I'm not sure if they figured this out by chance or intent, but they know it now. The continued anger stoking and fear mongering is much like Facebooks dopamine targetting.\n\nYour base needs an enemy to channel their anger. People rally around the cry to defeat an enemy. Democrats are no longer \"wrong\", they are now \"evil\", and they want to \"destory america\". Nevermind how absolutely ridiculous it is for any politician to actively want to destroy the democratic process.\n\nEnter Trump.\n\nNow you have someone running on the platform created by this artificial reality. Not only is he good at staying message of the alternative reality, he's convincing and brings the ridiculous notions into the mainstream. Nobody outside of fox before this knew of the alternative reality, so they didn't even know where to being to fact check it. It was all too fast. From tradition and for legal purposes, you can't just call someone a liar when they lie. So the media used gentle language. But Fox didn't. This made it seem like all the other media outlets were working together to share a \"false narrative\", despite the opposite.\n\nPeople get confused, and don't know what to believe, so they go to the only place with all the answers, the internet. Unprecedented disinformation ensues. However, this is not unlike the propaganda in Germany. Basically \"shit is bad, it's these people's fault, let's hate on them.\"\n\nTrump gets elected.\n\nSame testing of the waters happens with government now. \"Can we fire people that say things we don't like?\" Yep. \"Can we hide evidence of crimes to get here?\" Yep. \"Shit looks like we might get caught. The GOP benefits from this, do you think they'll bail us?\" Yep.\n\nThe testing of the waters was done in Germany too. Every failure of a check or balance emboldens someone seeking power. The peak before shit got bad in Germany was \"the night of the long knives\".\n\nI'm genuinely terrified Trump will use the Proud Boys to do this here amid the confusion of the election. After this point, there is no democracy, it's a dictatorship. If you are paying attention to the rest of the world, it's itching for a big war again, but there are nukes now.\n\nVote like the world depends on it, because it does, it fucking does."

I just want to point out I didn't mean life becomes boring.  I was just talking about lack of those major separators we had as children like summer vacation, new school, your first kiss, etc. Due to those major separators missing I don't recall if I did something a year ago or 3 years ago. It's a little blurry if something happened 2 weeks ago or 4 months ago.  This is because once you have a career and a home you're doing a lot of similar things most days(work, chores, cooking,  hobbies, etc).  This is why the days start to blend into one another, at least in your memory."

        "title": "30 Quick Tips For Attracting Women",
        "content": "1. If you're going to use Tinder, use the app Photofeeler to get actual women to rate your pictures so you can find out which ones are attractive to women.\n2. If you live in a big city, join your local game global group to find wingmen that you can go out with to meet women.\n3. Make your intentions clear sooner rather than later. You can do this by simply saying, \"You're actually kind of cute.\" at some point. This will prevent you from getting stuck in the friend zone and also shows a lot of confidence which is in itself, attractive.\n4. To get good pictures for dating apps, go meet a friend for a photoshoot and take at least 100 pictures of each other. Most of them will suck, but a few will be really good. Most high-end phones from the last few years can take good enough pictures.\n5. Don't leave meeting women up to chance. Set a goal for going out x times per week and stick to it. Treat this like you would any other skill you want to develop - fitness, learning an instrument, etc. If you don't make a commitment to yourself, you probably won't take any action whatsoever.\n6. Remember that fortune favors the bold, every girl you don't ask out is rejecting you by default. Every girl you do ask out might say yes. \n7. Getting into better shape will be good for your self-image, and it definitely won't hurt your attractiveness to women. Just make sure you don't use \"getting ripped\" as an excuse to procrastinate on trying to meet women until you meet some mythical goal in the distant future.\n8. If you feel proud of the way you're living your life, women will feel it too. Having hobbies and following your passions in life will change the way you carry yourself and make you significantly more attractive. Read good books, be physically active, learn new skills, these won't only improve your life in general, but they'll improve your dating prospects as well.\n9. Join local groups on the website meetup.com as a way to socialize and meet new people. Some cities will have singles groups you can use as a way to practice flirting.\n10. Pay attention to the way you talk to girls. You may notice that you speak in a higher pitch, and you talk faster. This generally makes you come across as less confident. If this is the case, make a point to add pauses, speak slower, and lower your voice. You can use the app Vocular to practice this consciously.\n11. Read the Art of Seduction by Robert Greene. It's a dark book, and it has a lot of manipulation in it, but it also has many deep insights into the psychology behind what makes people fall in love. After reading the book, you will have a much stronger understanding of how to seduce someone.\n12. If you have approach anxiety, start by simply saying hello to girls as you walk by them. That will be easier than a committed approach. Then, once you're used to greeting girls as they walk by, take the next step by approaching a girl and asking her if she knows anywhere good to get food nearby. Once you've done that a few times, you'll eventually reach a point where you're comfortable enough talking to strangers that you'll be able to approach a girl with a direct line like, \"I thought you looked interesting, and I had to meet you.\"\n13. Don't think you have to touch a girl or tease a girl to get a date with her. The only thing you need to do is invite her to hang out with you again; focus on doing that consistently before you worry about anything else.\n14. If you approach multiple women in a short span, you will build something called social momentum. Social momentum is a state of increased confidence in which you stop overthinking and fully trust your instincts. Getting into this state can completely change your perception of yourself.\nThe next tips are key signs that a girl is attracted to you:\n15. She laughs even when you don't say something very funny.\n16. She fills in conversational gaps by asking you questions.\n17. She talks quickly and with a higher pitch than usual. \n18. She touches her hair repeatedly. \n19. She touches you - this one is less common than the others, but it's a very good sign.\n20. Being aware of the signs a girl will give you that she's attracted is helpful, but every girl is different, and the only way to know for sure if someone likes you is to ask her on a date, invite her back to your place, or go for the kiss.\n21. You don't need to have a different kind of conversation with a girl to attract her. You can talk just like you would with your friends. The only difference is that you show your intent at some point and take the lead. \n22. Picking up women should be fun. If you're taking yourself too seriously, women won't find your energy attractive. Make fun of yourself. Make fun of the girls you talk to. Smile, laugh, be playful.k\n23. Game is a skill, but luck plays a significant role, too. If you approach ten girls, there's a high chance that one of them will happen to find you charming, or maybe she just broke up with her boyfriend and is looking for a fling. The more charismatic you are, the higher the percentages will be, but luck will always play a key role, and it's essential to play the numbers game in your favor.\n24. If a girl gives you choosing signals, make sure to approach her. But if, in general, you wait for women to give you clear signs of interest before approaching, you'll probably turn that into an excuse to avoid approaching anyone.\n25. Women enjoy sex more than men. Don't think of sex as something you're trying to get; think of it as a type of value you're offering. This mindset will increase your confidence.\n26. If you want to take online dating seriously, it's worth paying a professional photographer for a photo shoot. High-quality photos can make the difference between women rating you as a 4 and a 9.5. I'm not exaggerating; the difference between the best and worst ratings my pictures get on Photofeeler is more than 5 points.\n27. If you want to become wittier or more charismatic, one of the best sources available is standup comedy specials. Watching them will help you understand humor on a deep level.\n28. If you're struggling to get any dates, honestly ask yourself if anyone else would be getting dates taking the actions you're taking? Are you really trying, or are you thinking too much and not putting yourself out there enough?\n29. Give yourself credit for small wins. A lot of guys think everything other than getting laid is a failure. This will lead you to lose motivation. Instead, be proud of yourself for approaching a girl, for making a woman laugh, for getting a number, every small step in the right direction is a win - it's critical to remember that.\n30. Don't take the decision to get into a relationship lightly. Many men learn about pickup and get into relationships with women that they don't have a great connection with, and they end up getting married and having children with the wrong person. Have very high standards for yourself when it comes to making that commitment because you will spend much of your free time with your significant other.\n\nIf you liked this article, you can find more of content like this on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4kTcVi-b_9qQnMCRG9WggA"

That's a different issue. \n\nHis shady, personally guaranteed loans from state connected foreign entities are the national security problem. \n\nTrump isn't paying down these loans by billing the secret service for 5 figures a year, he's paying them by enacting policy that benefits these state actors. He can't do that if he loses. \n\nBut it only gets worse for him from there if he does lose: Trump's justice department is never going to pursue the national security angle to this. There's no way SDNY can flip enough mid level contractors to RICO a money laundering or tax fraud case against the Trump organization while Trump is a sitting president with the DOJ in his pocket. \n\nBut the chances are much, much better if he loses power. All of a sudden, the FBI and a large group of alphabet soup agencies are interested in these dealings, in addition to financial regulators. \n\nIt's much easier to flip people when federal agents are saying \"hey, we're interested in the former president's business dealings from a national security angle, and we're wondering how you're involved in that\". At that point, if you're a dude in manhattan that got paid a lot of money to pretend to refurbish a bunch of luxury condos, the cost benefit analysis really starts to change. \n\nThis is why Donnie is willing to burn the house down and risk further exposure in order to stay in power, and it's why Donald Jr. looks like he's on speed all the time now. Losing means not only likely bankruptcy while you owe kneecappers money, it means the most effective and empowered law enforcement agencies in our country will suddenly have great interest in him. \n\nBuckle up folks.

Depending on how long the crunch time is for, there needs to be a number of free \"vacation days\". I would say for a 6 day work week for more than a month, each employee should be able to take at least one full weekend off per month without using vacation time. Otherwise people break.\n\nAt the end of the day it sucks, but it is nice when the hefty paychecks come around. Some people are more resistant to overtime crunch than others, and I hate when I see management single those people out as \"non team players\"."

        "content": "Suite à [ce post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pedale/comments/7bd2cf/guide_du_cycliste_urbain_appel_%C3%A0_contribution/) , voici un modeste guide prenant en compte les retours. Merci à tous pour vos contributions.\n\n**Conseils de survie du cycliste en ville dans un pays où il peut faire froid et / ou pleuvoir**, par ordre de priorité (la priorité 1 étant ne pas mourir, la 2 le confort) :\n\n**Casque**. Au début on se sent con, c'est désagréable, mais rapidement on s'y fait, moi maintenant je me sens limite nu sans. Un casque réduit fortement tes chances d'être parmi les centaines de cyclistes français tués chaque année. Sur ce point, il y a un débat dans la communauté : mon avis [ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/pedale/comments/7bd2cf/guide_du_cycliste_urbain_appel_%C3%A0_contribution/dph8zui/). \n\n**Protection contre le vol**. 1000 vélos volés par jour en France. Rien ne m'enrage autant que de m'être fait piquer un vélo, c'est pas une question de fric, c'est le sentiment d'injustice, auquel s'ajoute le fait qu'à moins de faire le détective toi-même, tu peux te brosser pour que les flics fassent la moindre chose pour attraper les fils de putes qui font ça. Et ça va loin, je peux en témoigner. Même dans les caves, les cours d'immeuble, le vol est hyper courant. Donc : \n\n-\tantivol : minimum : un U de bâtard ; ou un pliable d'enculé http://antivolvelo.net/ . TOUJOURS locker au moins 1 roue ET le cadre. Si possible, en acheter 2 pour locker la roue avant et la roue arrière. \n-\tNe rien laisser de facilement démontable sur ton vélo : ex : lumières, et de cher : ex une belle selle. \n-\tEnsuite : mieux vaut attacher son vélo bien en vue que dans une ruelle sombre et peu passante. \n-\tNe pas hésiter à amochir son vélo aussi pour le rendre moins glam. Ex : stickers sur le cadre. \n\n**Visibilité**. Si tu es amené à rouler la nuit : il faut que tu soies ultra visible. Il faut se dire que les scooters ont des feux presque dignes de ceux d'une voiture, et que ça ne suffit pas toujours ; il faut aussi se dire que le conducteur moyen est déconcentré, ne regarde pas, parle au téléphone aussi voir textote, etc. La base : une lumière rechargeable PUISSANTE avant + arrière, facilement démontable (ne jamais les laisser sur son vélo attaché) ; 1 gilet de sécurité (comme pour les chantiers), qu’on passe par-dessus le sac à dos. Déjà avec ça on est assez visible normalement. Bons compléments à envisager en fonction de la luminosité des routes par lesquelles tu passes : des petites bandes réfléchissantes, voir clignotantes, qu’on peut scratcher autour de tes chevilles (ça aide accessoirement à ce que le jean ne se prenne pas dans la chaîne).\n\n**Réparation du vélo** : le min à avoir dans le sac à dos, si tu fais une distance conséquente chaque jour (conséquente = si ça devient inenvisageable de marcher cette distance en poussant ton vélo) :\n\n- démontes pneus en plastique ;\n- 1 chambre à air de rechange ;\n- 1 mini-pompe ;\n- 1 jeu de clé allen pliable (comme un couteau suisse).\n\n**Froid** : \n\n-\tOreilles : 1 bandeau de cyclisme serré. Ca coûte genre 5 euros chez decath. Sérieux l'homme n'est pas fait pour avoir les oreilles découvertes se prendre un vent de 30 kmh gelé pendant ne serait ce que 10 min. \n-\tIdem pour les mains : gants. Quand il fait vraiment froid, gants de ski.\n-\tIdem pour les voies respiratoires : cache-cou chez decath : 5e. A considérer éventuellement : masque en coton.\n\n**Pluie** : un kway simple, mais on ne va pas se mentir : contre la pluie, en vélo, tout a ses limites. Vaut mieux se dire tant pis, je serai mouillé et se changer en arrivant qu'essayer de rester sec à tout prix, car ça ne marche tout simplement pas passé un stade (distance + intensité de la pluie) : l'eau finit forcément par pénétrer ; de plus si tu mets un truc vraiment 100% imperméable, tu vas tellement transpirer que tu seras trempé de l'intérieur. Il n’y a pas de miracle.\n\n**Entretien du vélo** : Se renseigner, il y a des gestes de nettoyages périodiques tout cons qui vont faire la différence entre un vélo qui dure 15 ans en restant agréable , et un truc qui grince et cliquète de partout au bout de 6 mois. Apprendre à régler la selle, les freins, les dérailleurs.\n\n**Comportement sur la route** : évidemment, respecter les feux rouges, les stops, (by the way, et c'est une bonne chose, attention ça verbalise maintenant là-dessus) ne pas rouler sur les trottoirs, ne pas couper la route aux gens, quand on tourne à une intersection, attention, les piétons ont toujours vert et ils sont prioritaires. Mais le plus important est de pas rouler en pariant sur le comportement des autres. Il faut toujours être prêt au pire, pas rouler en se disant que ça va bien se passer. Par ex (liste non exhaustive) :\n\n- ne pas se faufiler entre 1 bagnole et un bus ;\n- ne pas se mettre entre un véhicule et le bord de la route à l'approche d'une intersection, car le véhicule peut tourner sans voir le cycliste ;\n- ne pas rouler pas à moins de 50cm voir 80cm des voitures garées (le coup de la portière ouverte sans regarder tue des dizaines de gens chaque année...) ;\n- ne pas rester longtemps à côté d'une voiture, car même si on n’est pas forcément dans son angle mort, les gens oublient notre présence et peuvent nous serrer contre le bord ;\n- dans une zone avec pas mal de piétons, toujours être prêt à l'éventualité qu'un mec traverse subitement sans regarder ;\n- attention aux autres cyclistes, yen a plein qui font n'importe quoi ;\nquand tu remontes une file de voiture, fais-le à une vitesse lente : t'auras toujours un con pour déboîter dans ta file sans regarder.\n\nEt **le meilleur** pour la fin : logguer tous ses trajets sur Strava et tous les partager sur facebook. Partager plein d'articles anti-voiture. Expliquer à tout le monde que t'as perdu X kilos grâce au vélo. Se dire que tout cycliste plus rapide que soi, c'est normal c'est parce qu'il a du meilleur matos.\n\nEt en doublant les vélibs/(surtout) les mecs en VAE tu cries « LE VELO C'EST PAS POUR LES PÉDALES » ou sinon « BAH ALORS PAPY ?! ON FATIGUE ? »."

        "content": "Globalement, le système de Sécurité sociale en France est financé par les cotisations sociales, payées par les salariés et leurs employeurs, qui sont distinctes des impôts en cela que les impôts n'ouvrent droit à aucune contrepartie (ex : ce n'est pas parce que tu payes 10 000 € en impôts que tu auras le droit à un service public de l'éducation de meilleure qualité par rapport à qqn qui n'en paye que 100 €). \n\nEn France on a fait le choix de la solidarité collective s'agissant de nos dépenses de protection sociale. D'autres pays ont fait le choix de privatiser cette fonction (ex : les États-Unis), mais cela ne veut pas dire que les personnes dans ces États dépensent moins en santé en proportion de leur revenu disponible. En réalité la part des dépenses de santé dans le PIB des États-Unis est supérieure à celle de la France (12 % vs 11 %).\n\nUne deuxième raison pourquoi la protection sociale coûte aussi chère est qu'on observe aujourd'hui une double tendance depuis 30-40 ans : \n\nD'une part, une hausse des dépenses sociales :\n\n* Elles peuvent être liées aux innovations technologiques qui peuvent entraîner à la hausse du coût des soins notamment dans les hôpitaux. \n\n* Ensuite si l'espérance de vie est élevée en France, l'espérance de vie en bonne santé recule. C'est un double constat qui explique la hausse des coûts : les dépenses liées aux soins médicaux prodigués aux personnes âgées augmentent, puisqu'ils vivent plus longtemps, et ensuite les personnes âgées de santé fragile nécessitent davantage de soin (appelés prestations de dépendance)\n\nD'autre part, une baisse des recettes : \n\n* D'abord le financement par les seules cotisations est aujourd'hui peu adapté, dans la mesure où les revenus ne sont plus uniquement issus du travail et se sont diversifiés (revenus de remplacement et revenus du patrimoine), ce qui crée une assiette différente de la réalité des revenus. \n\n* Les cotisations sociales ont elles aussi diminué au cours des trente dernières années, d'abord du fait du vieillissement de la population ce qui fait que la part de la population active (et donc créatrice de richesse) diminue, alors que les retraités ne cotisent pas. \n\n* Cette diminution aussi est liée aux politiques économiques des Gouvernements qui n'ont pas hésité à multiplier les allègements de charge, les exonérations et les exemptions d'assiette à des fins de compétitivité éco de la France et d'augmentation de l'emploi.\n\nEn somme, la protection sociale coûte cher aujourd'hui parce que la France a fait le choix de collectiviser ses dépenses sociales, ce qui est un choix de Société. Mais d'autre part, la hausse des dépenses sociales et la baisse des recettes conduit aussi à augmenter ce coût."

Il prend le temps d'expliquer, il projette de l'empathie, et il rassure.  \nDe jouer à la violence contre la violence, ça marche pas contre les \"mauvais\" non plus d'ailleurs (c'est pas le terroriste qui vient de découper quelqu'un qui va soudainement craquer quand on le fout face au mur avec menottes), mais ça marche beaucoup contre les autres comme dans le cas de Youssef (on lui demande s'il veut un avocat et il dit qu'évidemment que non parce qu'il est là pour aider - le truc à jamais faire même si on est pas coupable malheureusement..).  \n\nEt on en revient à un truc typique qui passe toujours pas: que la police aie l'impression qu'il faille montrer quelqu'un aux médias, c'est bel est bien qu'il y a un problème au-delà même de la police, vu qu'ils ont pas comme seul objectif de résoudre le problème mais aussi de pas passer pour des cons auprès des médias et politiques (ce qui va forcément influencer leur boulot).  \nMais les \"news en mode immédiat\" vont jamais publiquement faire de mea culpa et ré-ajuster leur communication parce qu'ils se donnent le droit de dire tout et n'importe quoi, peu importe le prix. Parce qu'il faut semblerait-il de l'information toujours plus fraîche que les légumes de Rungis (sans quoi on risquerait de crever? pfft) - même si l'information est, en vrai, plutôt pourrie jusqu'à la moelle."

If it's big and unwieldy, I break it down into smaller things until I have them in manageable pieces, then I just start on whatever part is easiest and/or practical to work on right now.\n\nAnd you can do that with pretty much anything, from some specific task you are trying to accomplish all the way down to working your way out of depression (I'm not saying it's the cure for depression, I'm just saying it's what worked for me).   \n\nSo at one point in my life shit was really bad. Economically struggling, studies falling to shit, work falling to shit, girlfriend ditched me.You get the point, everything just went wrong all at once.. Just overall everything was shit, and I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed, didn't get dressed, ate like shit.    \nSo I started with \"Gonna get out of bed today\".   \nThen \"gonna get dressed today\".    \n\"Gonna make some proper food today\".    \n\"Gonna work out today\".    \n\"Gonna clean my bedroom today\"   \n\nBasically choose the first thing that's not being done, fix that, then add a new one.    \nGot me out of the depression, back into uni, got my degree, fixed my shit, etc.\n\nAnd now that's pretty much what I do whenever I face a problem, start breaking it down into easier things, then start doing them.   \nAnd since I'm actively fixing things and working on something my emotions calm down, I get busy focusing on what I'm doing, my stress levels go down, and I feel safer."

Marriage may seem attractive, but only because it offers a false sense of security and safety that is necessary for survival in the world today.  \n\n\nThe reason is that marriage will inevitably lead to disillusionment and, in some cases, divorce. This means that one or both partners will eventually be left feeling resentful, betrayed and/or abandoned.  \n\n\nMarriage has been used by women for centuries to enslave men, and it is still being used today. The human desire to reproduce is inextricably linked with our survival instinct, which we inherited from our ancestors.  \n\n\nIn order to reproduce, males need females. Females understand this instinctively and use it to their advantage in order to manipulate men into giving them what they want.  \n\n\nThis is why women are attracted to men who appear successful, powerful and wealthy. It is also the reason that they tend to 'marry up'. In other words, they marry individuals whose success, power and wealth exceed their own.  \n\n\nIn doing so, women hope to secure a good provider for themselves and their children. However, once married, many of them become dissatisfied with the status quo and begin to resent their husbands.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJesus...Incel AI has spoken...."

Seriously though, doing completely mental tasks withe the only things changing being limited to a screen you look at occasionally can be draining.\n\nIt's why many of the most well adjusted programmers I know started taking up hobbies like cooking, welding, woodworking, painting models, 3D printing, etc. \n\nThe happiest programmer I ever knew was a buddy of mine who worked as a freelance programmer working remotely from various campsites with his dog.

        "content": "Sure. \n\nCV:\n\n* If you're young, you don't really have to defend not having a job before. Everyone has a first job.\n* Related hobby experience and skills are nice. Really depends on the job you're applying. Pizza place? McDonalds? They don't care about skills, they just want warm bodies. Ad designer? Programmer? They care for basically nothing except your skills. Will probably require a portfolio.\n* One page resume tops. Google 'example resume/cv' and keep looking at them until you figure out what they're there for. *(Edit: Due to several comments, I want to clarify that this is specifically for 1st-jobbers. When you're established it varies, but it's really hard to justify more than 1 page without any work experience)*\n* List major accomplishments and positions of trust. Eagle Scout, Student councils, head of a club, leadership positions in hobby groups or nonprofit organizations. Referee/organizer for chess club tournaments? Recruiters love that.\n* If you don't have any of those, start thinking about how to get some of those. A lot of colleges will screen you for extracurriculars. Depending on what entry-level job you want, you can pick up a LOT of relevant skills\n* If you've done 'unofficial' work for someone, ask them for a reference. Just list this person's qualifications and phone number/email. Preferably someone with a different last name than you.\n* Send a cover letter as well. Concise, half a page, 1st paragraph introduce yourself, 2nd paragraph show that you've done research on the company/position and why you'd be a good fit 3rd paragraph close. Make it look nice and presentable, Google helps a lot with this.\n* Send everything in PDF/printed, NO OTHER FORMATS. But have your cover letter also as text in case they want you to send it just via email.\n\nInterview:\n\n* Be presentable. Collared shirt, long skirt/trousers, no flashy colours. SHOWER. DEODORANT. \n* Be on time. Aim to be there 5-10 minutes beforehand. Don't schedule it so you have to run and be sweaty and panting when you start the interview.\n* Be prepared to talk about things that are on your CV. Have your CV printed with you for reference.\n* Be polite. Introduce yourself and be patient if necessary.\n* Turn your phone to silent. \n* Don't bring your parents to the building or the interview room. Don't let them call the place before or after.\n* If you stumble, your phone chirps, you spill something or do a similar silly mistake, DON'T PANIC. It's fine to be anxious and weirded out, you're in a new situation! Just take a deep breath, apologize and move on. The interviewer doesn't expect you to be perfect, but a calm resolution and moving on is a very, very professional approach and will score you points. \n\nGood luck."

        "content": "Answer: Long story short, in the USA there are 9 judges on the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has the final say on the interpretation of laws and the constitution. Though judges are supposed to be non-partisan, in reality judges can be categorized as conservative or liberal. Also, once appointed, Justices serve for life or until voluntary retirement.\n\nGinsburg was not only a liberal judge, but in the eyes of many, the standard bearer of liberalism on the court. More importantly, the court has been relatively balanced the past couple decades with 4 liberals, 4 conservatives and one relative swing vote. When a supreme court Justice dies, their successor is nominated by the current president and that nominee must be approved by the US Senate.\n\nBoth the current president and the US senate are controlled by the conservative Republican Party. This means that they can replace a liberal judge with a lifetime appointment of a conservative. This would swing the balance of power in the court to 5 conservatives, 3 liberals, and one swing vote (that swing being Chief Justice Robert's, who already leans conservative). This would make the court rule in ways conservatives want for potentially decades.\n\nTo further complicate matters, during the last election, while Obama (a member of the Democratic Party and a liberal) was president, a conservative justice Antonin Scalia died. However, Democrats did not control the senate, and so could not confirm Obama's nominee, with the Republicans refusing to consider a nominee until the next president was elected. With a presidential election much closer to Ginsburg's death than it was to Scalia's, many want senate Republicans to wait for the election results until a nominee is considered. However there is no law that requires this, and as Republicans control both the presidency and senate, there is nothing forcing them to wait to nominate and confirm a conservative judge to the Court."

We need to be very wary of dissolving subreddit boundaries, and of content ordering not based on vote count.\n\nThere have always been echochambers. The guys on the construction site were always pretty right leaning, the university students were always pretty left leaning (or whatever groups are relevant and what their beliefs are), and it was always hard to have opinions contrary to the prevailing ones if you want to be accepted in those groups. Modern social media, which recommends content on a feed curated by some black box algorithm, is a different beast that takes the problems of echochambers and amplifies them.

Since it's so recent, I haven't started on writing documentation yet, though most of it can be ripped from the official processing docs.\n\nThe entry point to the library is the CLI, which is in the `__main__.py` file (running a processing script is as simple as `python -m pyprocessing path/to/my/processing_script.py`). That CLI, in turn, instanciate a `Runner`, which dynamically loads the script as a python module in order to access its functions. Then some values are set on the `PyProcessing` singleton, renderers are attached, and they all are run.\n\nI did it that way in order to be able to implement several kinds of renderers down the line, such as rendering the result on a web page, in other GUI toolkits, or in pyglet/pygame."

Channels like carykh, Coding Train or Code Bullet use that language. I got the idea while watching a video from that last youtuber, who had to code his AI again in python because of missing libraries for processing  (in this case, tensorflow). Thus began this project.\n\nSo far, the implementation is pretty bare bones, it doesn't quite work, but the framework is there. If you're looking for a fresh project to contribute to, and are not too spooked by OOP and metaprogramming, you're welcome to contribute.\n\nI plan to support every feature from processing, as well as give the ability to render the app with tkinter, pyqt, pygame, or as a webserver. One of my goals is to keep the syntax as close as I can to the original language (albeit pythonized, for instance, snake_case instead of camelCase) and using the standard library as much as possible.\n\nI am aware that [processing.py](https://py.processing.org) exists, but it doesn't seem to be maintained anymore (it only supports python 2), and it's not really a python package, but more of a syntactic change on processing, therefore one can not import it in a python script, or use third-party python libraries with it (it seems to be very limited)"

        "content": "Let's jump into it.\n\n# All tutorials are not created equal\n\nImagine yourself as a lab rat.\n\nAs you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That’s fine. In fact, that’s exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.\n\nAfter you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.\n\nWhen I started, I used to bang my head against *Head First Java*, the book. But after studying for many hours, I just wasn’t getting anywhere. Yet, everyone online said it was the best book ever. But an old java youtube tutorials did it for me.\n\nI wish I could say this stopped after my 1st year.\n\nFast forward 2 years down the line when I started learning algorithms and *ALL* the blog tutorials I followed just didn’t make sense until I watched Youtube videos on Hungarian folk dance teaching algorithms.\n\nAnd it just clicked.\n\nSince then, my approach to learning has been **to learn the same thing from multiple places until I find the instructor and style that works for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Work within fear; not against it\n\nI’ll admit: this one is easier than done.\n\nBut you have to master this if you want to last long.\n\nThere’s this temptation to fix your fear first before you continue to learn. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work like that.\n\nIn fact, you’ll spend a lot of time trying to make your fear disappear that it’ll only double your anxiety. You have to find a way – your way – to acknowledge that you’re afraid, and frankly will continue to be afraid for a long time, then work within that realization. No need to fight it.\n\nSometimes, this fear disappears as you become more proficient.\n\nOther times, it vanishes for a while and comes back when you get into a new environment, work with smart people, or move to a completely new stack.\n\nIt’s okay.\n\n**This** ***IS*** **the life.**\n\nIt’s a sinusoidal wave – endlessly going up and down. Don’t take it too seriously or you’ll lose yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# You’ll forget a lot of things\n\nDeeply understanding this will change how you learn.\n\nI can’t can’t the number of times I took Introduction to Python programming on Udacity, Coursera, etc and still forgot everything.\n\nIt’s so annoying.\n\nBut I’ve since learned that you’ll forget anything you learn in isolated exercises because they are stored in short term memory. Neuroscience research shows that this is just how the brain works.\n\nIf you don’t want to forget, test your knowledge using spaced repetitions. To do this, build projects.\n\nI’ll give you a concrete example: len(myList) will give you the length of a list in Python. You’ll learn this in Udacity’s intro course.\n\nCome back a month later and you might not remember if it’s len, length() or myList.size( ).\n\nBut with spaced repetition through a project, the outcome is different. For example, you work on a 2-month long Django app for new coders where you need to count multiple times the number of users, the number of exercises done, the number of chats, etc. Imagine doing this throughout the span of the project, for two months. it’s hard to forget what len( ) does.\n\nThis is a trivial example, but hopefully you get the idea.\n\nNew learners can start with simple, isolated examples.\n\nBut **if you’re not practicing within the scope of a project that makes you use and reuse what you’ve learned, nothing is going into your long term memory;** it’s all short-term. And you’ll forget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Consistency > hard work\n\nConsistency is king.\n\nWhen you start learning,  you lay down neural pathways that make it easier to retrieve information. According to Neuroscience research, these pathways only get strong through frequency of use, not just intensity.\n\n**This means 30 minutes a day, for 5 days a week is way better than 2.5 hours one day, only once a week.**\n\nSame hours; Different impact.\n\nDon’t just work hard, apply wisdom here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Talent = hidden practice\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss progress as talent.\n\nMy first programming class was in C++ and my classmates refused to believe I had never coded before because I was *just-so-talented*.\n\nBut what they also refused to accept was that right after class, I would spend five hours typing *cout << “this is my first program”,* realize it didn’t run because I forgot a semicolon; retype it and realize it didn’t print out my statement on a new line because I didn’t add *endl*.\n\nThis deliberate practice built perceived talent.\n\nTalent is sexier than hustle so no one wants to hear that you worked hard and got here. Just tell me you were born this way - it’s more believable.\n\nBut becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument.\n\nOnly a tiny few are born talented.\n\n**The majority can only get as good as the amount of practice they put in.** And you can immediately tell a student hasn’t been practicing the moment they sit at the keyboard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# You’ll meet a**holes\n\nI’m not sure what it is about this field that attracts a\\*\\*holes. Maybe because coding gives the feeling of having a super-power or a rare skill.\n\nIf you’re a newbie, you’ll meet those who’ve been coding for years and think no one else should come in.\n\nA windows developer only? You’ll meet linux fanatics that think you’re mediocre.\n\nIf you’re a woman, you’ll immediately be dismissed because of your gender. I know this from personal stories from colleagues over the years.\n\nIf you’re a minority, you’ll meet people who think you should only fetch coffee; not code.\n\nIf you’re coming from another field (particularly not STEM), you’ll meet people who automatically make themselves gatekeepers of the programming community. *“We don’t want social scientists here; we’re purists!”*\n\nThey’re online. At work. And sadly sometimes in your family.\n\n*It’s not if you’ll meet them, it’s when.*\n\n**Learn to move on.**\n\nThings are getting better but there’s still a lot to do to educate people.\n\nBut don’t let this deter you. Build your resilience so you don’t quit after you meet these people.\n\nAnd when you get to the top don't be an a\\*\\*hole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Master 1 thing\n\nNew devs tend to jump around learning a lot of things.\n\nOkay, it’s not just new devs; it’s also experienced folks.\n\nYou learned React for one week.\n\nThen Django for two weeks.\n\nLaravel for three.\n\n**Stop**.\n\nYou need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you’re simply extending the time it’ll take you to truly learn anything.\n\n>*“If one is a master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.”* \\- Vincent Van Gogh\n\nPick one thing.\n\nStick with it for a few months – ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else.\n\nThis has two benefits:\n\n1. You’ll go deep enough and hit critical mass that moves you towards mastery.\n2. After you master one domain, you can transfer knowledge to another.Learn Flask and you can easily walk into Django. Learn React deeply, and you can quickly identify the pros and cons of Laravel within a few days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Software dev is an ever evolving field.\n\nIt’s exciting.\n\nIt’s frustrating.\n\nIt’s intimidating.\n\nBut if I had to, I’d do it all over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thanks for reading\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.\n\nI’m trying out a new initiative to help new developers feel less overwhelmed and learn smarter.\n\nTo be honest, I’m not sure what this looks like yet. But I’m putting together some resources and write-ups based on what people need the most help with.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’m [@LifeTechPsych](https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych) on Twitter. Feel free to DM me what you’d need help with.\n\nHeads up - I love research so I tend to back my advice and approach with concepts from Behavioral Psychology and Neuroscience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: removed mention of old java youtube tutorial I used back in the day but I see is now discouraged.\n\n**Edit 2:** This blew up more than I expected. I'll do my best to get to all questions and DMs. There are interesting questions about tutorials and studying patterns that I think others will benefit from so I'll shoot to write posts in the future that specifically address those. The Learning never stops! Let's go!!\n\n**Edit 3:** I initially didn't link to my blog post with images. But another blog copy-pasted this poorly and w/o credit. So here goes a [proper blog post](https://www.lifetechpsych.com/lessons-for-junior-dev/)."

        "content": "Astronomer here!  Here is what is going on!\n\nFor many years, astronomers have speculated that the most likely way to find evidence of extraterrestrial life is via [biosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature), which are basically substances that provide evidence of life.  Probably the most famous example of this would be oxygen- it rapidly oxidizes in just a few thousand years, so to have large quantities of oxygen in an atmosphere you need something to constantly be putting it there (in Earth's case, from photoplankton and trees).  Another one that's been suggested as a great biosignature is [phosphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine)- a gas we can only make on Earth in the lab, or via organic matter decomposing (typically in a water-rich environment, which Venus is not).  So, to be abundantly clear, the argument here is to the best of our knowledge you should *only* get this concentration of phosphine if there is life.\n\n***What did this group discover?  Is the signal legit?*** These scientists basically pointed [a submillimeter radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope) towards Venus to look for a signature of phosphine, which was not even a very technologically advanced radio telescope for this sort of thing, but they just wanted to get a good benchmark for future observations.  And... they found a phosphine signature.  They then pointed another, better radio telescope at it ([ALMA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/)- hands down best in the world for this kind of observation) and measured this signal even better.  I am a radio astronomer myself, and looking at [the paper]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4), I have no reason to think this is *not* the signature from phosphine they say it is.  They spend a lot of time estimating other contaminants they might be picking up, such as sulfur dioxide, but honestly those are really small compared to the phosphine signal.  There's also a lot on the instrumentation, but they do seem to understand and have considered all possible effects there.\n\n***Can this phosphine be created by non-life?*** The authors also basically spend half the paper going through allllll the different possible ways to get phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.  If you go check \"extended data Figure 10\" in the paper they go through all of the options, from potential volcanic activity to being brought in from meteorites to lightning... and all those methods are either impossible in this case, or would not produce you the concentration levels needed to explain the signature by several orders of magnitude (like, literally a million times too little).  As I said, these guys were very thorough, and brought on a lot of experts in other fields to do this legwork to rule options out!  And the only thing they have not been able to rule out so far is the most fantastic option. :) The point is, *either we don’t get something basic about rocky planets, or life is putting this up there.*\n\n(Mind, the way science goes I am sure by end of the week someone will have thought up an idea on how to explain phosphine in Venus's atmosphere.  Whether that idea is a *good* one remains to be seen.)\n\nTo give one example, It should be noted at this point that phosphine has apparently been detected in comets- specifically, it’s thought to be behind in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission- [paper link]( https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1600285).  Comets have long been known to have a ton of organic compounds and are water rich- some suggest life on Earth was seeded by comets a long time ago- but it’s *also* present in the coma of comets as they are near the sun, which are *very* different conditions than the Venusian atmosphere. (It’s basically water ice sublimating as it warms up in a comet, so an active process is occurring in a water-rich environment to create phosphine.) However, the amounts created are nowhere near what is needed for the amounts of phosphine seen in Venus, we do not have water anywhere near the levels on Venus to make these amounts of phosphine, and we have detailed radar mapping to show us there was no recent cometary impact of Venus.  As such, it appears highly unlikely that what puts phospine into Venus’s atmosphere is the same as what puts it into a comet’s coma.  [Research into this also indicates that, surprise surprise, cometary environments are very different than rocky ones, and only life can put it in the atmosphere of a rocky planet.]( http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/phosphine-biosignature-gas-07957.html\n)\n\n***How can life exist on Venus?  I thought it was a hell hole!*** The surface of Venus is indeed not a nice place to live- a runaway greenhouse effect means the surface is hot enough to melt lead, it rains sulfuric acid, and the Russian probes that landed there in didn't last more than a few hours. (No one has bothered since the 1980s.) However, if you go about 50 km up Venus's atmosphere is the most Earth-like there is in the Solar System, and this is where this signal is located. What's more, unlike the crushing pressure and hot temperatures on the surface, you have the same atmospheric pressure as on Earth, temps varying from 0-50 C, and pretty similar gravity to here.  [People have suggested we could even build cloud cities there.](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161019-the-amazing-cloud-cities-we-could-build-on-venus) And this is the region this biosignature is coming from- not the surface, but tens of km up in the pretty darn nice area to float around in.\n\nPlus, honestly, you know what I’m happy about that will come out of this?  More space exploration of Venus!  It is a fascinating planet that is criminally under-studied despite arguably some of the most interesting geology and atmosphere there is that we know of. (My favorite- Venus’s day is longer than its year, and it rotates “backwards” compared to all the other planets.  But we think that’s not because of the way it formed, but because some gigantic planet-sized object hit it in the early days and basically flipped it upside down and slowed its spin.  Isn’t that so cool?!) But we just wrote it off because the surface is really tough with old Soviet technology, and NASA hasn’t even sent a dedicated mission in over 30 years despite it being *literally the closest planet to us*.  I imagine that is going to change *fast* and I am really excited for it- bring on the Venus drones!\n\n[***So, aliens?***](https://media.giphy.com/media/RluM0kvZXkLS0/giphy.gif) I mean, personally if you're asking my opinion as a scientist... I think I will always remember this discovery as the first step in learning how common life is in the universe. :) To be clear, the \"problem\" with a biosignature is it does *not* tell you what is putting that phosphine into the Venusian atmosphere- something microbial seems a good bet (we have great radar mapping of Venus and there are def no cloud cities or large artificial structures), but as to what, your guess is as good as mine.  We do know that [billions of microbes live high up in the Earth's atmosphere](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/microbes-survive-and-maybe-thrive-high-atmosphere), feeding as they pass through clouds and found as high as 10km up.  So I see no reason the same can't be happening on Venus! (It would be life still pretty darn ok with sulfuric acid clouds everywhere, mind, but we have extremophiles on Earth in crazy environments too so I can’t think of a good reason why it’s *impossible*).\n\nIf you want to know where the smoking gun is, well here's the thing... Hollywood has well trained you to think otherwise, but I have always argued that discovering life elsewhere in the universe was going to be like discovering water on Mars.  Where, as you might recall, first there were some signatures that there was water on Mars but that wasn't conclusive on its own that it existed, then a little more evidence came in, and some more... and finally today, everyone knows there is water on Mars.  There was no reason to think the discovery of life wouldn't play out the same, because that's how science operates. (This is also why I always thought people were far too simplistic in assuming we would all just drop everything and unite as one just because life was discovered elsewhere- there'd be no smoking gun, and we'd all do what we all are doing now, get on social media to chat about it.) But put it this way- today we have taken a really big first step.  And I think it is *so amazing* that this was first discovered not only next door, but on a planet not really thought of as great for life- it shows there's a good chance life in some for is ubiquitous!  And I for one cannot wait until we can get a drone of some sort into the Venusian atmosphere to measure this better- provided, of course, we can do it in a way that ensures our own microbes don't hitch a ride.\n\nTL;DR- if you count microbes, which I do, we are (probably) not alone. :D\n\nEdit: There will be a Reddit AMA Wednesday at noon EDT from the team at /r/askscience!\n\n**Edit 2: A lot of questions about whether this could just be from bacteria that hitched a ride on our old probes.  The short answer is that's not really possible at the levels detected.  Life as we have it on Earth can't survive on Venus because of all the sulfuric acid clouds and such.  Even if something managed to do so, bacteria don't reproduce as fast as would be needed to explain this signal.**"

The more you invest in yourself, the more prepared you'll be when someone worthwhile comes along.\n\nIf someone *is* in your orbit, make a move. Fear holds everyone back in life. It's okay to be afraid, it's not okay to let fear rule your life. Make an effort to talk to someone you're actually interested in that you have an actual opportunity to date.\n\nIf the only thing you're finding are people who are unavailable or not someone you can feasibly try and ask out or connect with then you need to remember \"Look at whats in front of you.\" If someone is not in your orbit, enjoy your crush for a minute then move the fuck on.\n\nYou might be so busy thinking about other random people you might not realize there are options right in front of you."

        "content": "Before we could use satellites to take pictures from space, if we wanted to see what was going on in enemy territory, we had to take pictures from a plane.\n\n\n  \nEnemies didn't want us taking pictures so they would try to stop the plane - usually by blowing it up with missiles.\n\n  \n\nWe didn't have \"stealth\" technology yet to keep from being seen, so if we wanted to avoid getting hit with missiles, we needed a way to avoid them. The best way we could come up with was to go so fast they couldn't catch up.\n\n  \n\nBeing really high in the air helped this, because it's easier to go fast up high, and because it would take missiles so long to get up to you, you could be out of the area before they reached that height.\n\n  \nAs a result, the SR-71 was designed to go as high and as fast as possible.\n\n\n  \nSince then, we learned to build space satellites to take our pictures, which can't be hit with missiles. We also developed \"stealth\" technology for planes, which keeps them from being seen on radar. This means we no longer need to develop planes for high and fast work, so the SR-71 remains the best at that.\n\n(Edited to remove error related to a missile strike)"

        "content": "It's not the continuous charging that damages modern cellphones. Modern smart phones have smart charging causing them to switch to a trickle charge that keeps the battery topped off without over charging. There is some truth that keeping a cellphones batter near 100% often will damage the cells, but it's not because of overcharging.\n\nThe reason cellphone batteries weaken overtime is just wear and tear at the atomic level. Overtime as the battery charges and discharges the materials inside get worn and degrade and just don't work as well so they drain faster. Things that accelerate this wearing of cells are things like:\n\n* Letting the lithium battery fully drain before charging\n* Constantly charging to 100%\n* Excess heat builup\n* Freezing cold temperatures.\n\nThe above puts extra strain on the cells and makes them degrade faster. If you avoid these things the cells will still degrade from everyday charging, but not nearly as fast.\n\nYou also have to consider the phone is doing more work overtime as things update. As software/apps update they become more power/resource hungry. Your phone is going to drain the battery faster as it uses more processing power to handle the new software giving the illusion that your battery is going bad. Same idea as your computer is slowing down after a couple of years. It's the same speed, the games are just more demanding.\n\nComparing this to a portable house phone isn't really accurate. Your house phone most likely has the same problem with a worn out battery, You just don't use it for hours on end. If you have an old portable phone it may very well only last 10 minutes these days where when it was new it would last hours."

Just going off my experience) who might give you attention, flirt, etc, but that attention does not actually mean they want to pursue anything. I’ve had it apply to friendships too, where the person just wants someone to party with, go to bars, but isn’t interested in being more than an acquaintance. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong there, I just wasted a lot of time expecting too much from the attention givers.

That’s extremely normal & nothing wrong with wanting a partner to share a life with \n\nHowever you should strive to become a person who you think a special someone in the future would want to date \n\nWould you wish to date someone who feels lonely/depressed or someone who is appearing confident in who they are & doesn’t really care? \n\nNotice how I said appearing instead of “is confident.”\n\nMy point is that pain of feeling lonely may never go away but you can do your best to improve yourself as much as possible to the point where the special person you’re waiting for would show up when you least expect it \n\nI’ve asked out many girls in the past & only 3 said yes but the dates didn’t work out while the rest of the time on dating apps trying to make something long term work but so far nothing solid happened \n\nOne even agreed to date during Covid, I expressed concerns about health, she actually convinced me it would be okay, then she said she would lemme know when she’s back from a family trip to hmu for our date, then I texted her & she revealed she was already back for an entire week \n\nShe was hoping I would forget but I didn’t. Of course I felt hurt/betrayed but now I feel even worse for anybody in the future who she takes advantage of in terms of time & emotional investment \n\nIn the meantime I’m trying my best to keep myself fit, learn new hobbies that may help me in the future(learning Japanese right now), & refining my current hobbies of video editing/graphic design as well as teaching people online fighting games that I love \n\nAlso one thing I believe I’m confident in is that if I drop all my standards out the window such as not caring for any looks or if they’re drug addicts or overall a terrible person, I believe I can get a gf by next week no problem if I said yes to everyone on a dating app\n\nAre your standards somewhat high like my own? If yes, then you’re probably interested in the most attractive ones right both in looks as well as personality? \n\nThat’s normal & good to stick to however you must uphold yourself to an equivalent standard. Good thing is, working on yourself takes time & is rather distracting \n\nSo you’ll spend more time progressing/seeing growth in yourself physically as well as mentally as a person \n\nYou’re worth investing time in as much it is worth investing time into getting a relationship \n\nYou don’t need 6 pack abs in a month. Just take tiny tiny steps at least once a week \n\nCould be, walking straighter, choosing a healthier meal once in a while, get back into that hobby you liked as a kid but stopped because school got in the way, step out of your comfort zone by smiling more when talking to a cashier, compliment a stranger & make their day then see their faces light up since the world is shit/the bar for kindness is incredibly low \n\nDo anything that makes you or the world a better place \n\nyou should feel more accomplished as a whole about yourself vs your past self by either a day or even a year then if you keep that going, that’s the best life to live since you’re always going up \n\nA person will see that type of amazing value in you as you do in the future but if you keep tallying the days until they come you’ll never get out of that mental prison\n\nI hope this helps. I wish I told myself this years ago as a teenager\n\nEdit- I appreciate the awards & this is going to sound Disney corny as hell but if any of you truly apply anything I’ve mentioned here to your daily life onward, that’s more than enough of an award for me & I wish you the best/would love any future DM’d updates if you get the chance"

The gas was used to kill people in the gas chambers for half an hour a day, while the duration of disinfection in the disinfection chambers was, in line with the standard procedure, 24 hours—that is, 48 times as long.\" the report debunked: [http://auschwitz.org/en/history/holocaust-denial/leuchter-report](http://auschwitz.org/en/history/holocaust-denial/leuchter-report)  also worth mentioning: [https://remember.org/ideas/kz](https://remember.org/ideas/kz)\n3. *\"How were Germans cremating all those \"dead jews\"?\"* They weren't, survivors story tell that the Nazis forced the jew's families to burn their own family's dead bodies, and I had met a jew that was there. it was not an easy experience. here are the ways they did it with photos (TW: genocide, death, bodies, burned bodies.)

Some deaths were never confirmed (mostly jews that lived too far from the main cities were just killed at their homes beacuse of the cost that it would take to bring them to the gas chambers. whole communities become ghost towns by this practice) sorce and breakdown of the deaths: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) on \"Death toll\" tag. Worth mentioning: 1.5M out of the dead, were just children and babies, like Anna frank, they had the worst chances of surviving in the camps.\n6. *\"Why did the soviets build chimney at Auschwitz that doesn't even connect to gas chambers\"* It was connected, but in modern times went through restoration beacuse the museum was in bad shape: [https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab10-gas-chamber-fake/](https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab10-gas-chamber-fake/)\n7. *\"Why is it illegal talking to question the holocaust in many European countries?\"* Beacuse of the fear of people like you, who made this \"Nazi answer\" trying to do it again. After the war Nazism was something acceptable in Europe, and it ment the current goverments had to deal with new insane racist idiology that might indanger the values of freedom that Europe stand by, which is why they criminalised not just quastioning the holocust, but everything in the nazi idiology, for the simple reason they wanted to kill the evil seed in it's root. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality\\_of\\_Holocaust\\_denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Holocaust_denial) And, it's ONLY in Erupean countries, beacuse the holocust took place in Europe. Quote: \" Michael Whine argues that Holocaust denial can inspire violence against Jews; he states, \"Jews' experience in the post-World War II era suggests that their rights are best protected in open and tolerant democracies that actively prosecute all forms of racial and religious hatred\" \"\n\nPlease, share it and maybe copy all of those sources and claims, holocaust denial is still a thing, and unless we educate people, we wouldn't be able to stop it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you 💗\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: added sources and grammar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast edit: I wanted to thank everyone that helped me spread awarness, it is not a known fact, but middle eastern jew also suffered beacuse of the holocaust, my jewish iraqi family was a victim of nazi probogada in iraq, as a result my community including some of my family members, were massacared, the rest become refugees. it was known as the \"Fahud\" massacare of jews in Bagdad, over 100 innocent people died, my great uncle was one of them, my gradpa still miss him often. And that's only from the propaganda of the nazis, what happened in Europe was even worse, which is why I just can't forgive anyone denying what happened, and the magnitude of the event that even got my middle eastern jewish family from so far away involved. My community in iraq had 200,000 members, 100 died, the rest become refugees. today, no jews exist in Iraq anymore after over 2,000 years my old community lived there. no one is left. I dont want this memory of my people to be erased.\n\nSo Thank you for all the support, keep spreading awarness, so it will never happen again."

        "content": "OOF my dude.  Shits rough.  Right now you have a really good racist asshole detector in that young lady.  Since she is likely going to face racism her entire life, I think its your job and your ex wifes job, to make it clear any comments regarding race are going to be loudly and publicly called out.  You will have to have a zero tolerance policy for racism and you are now going to have to clearly and constantly call it out, forever.\n\nGotta set the example for your boys and for the little lady that racism has no place in this family.  \n\nThe boys cant be influenced by racist undertones if you don't fucking tolerate racist undertones.  Kids don't care about race, they learn about it from racists.  So you are going to have to cut a lot of people out of your life, because you are about to learn how many closet racists you are friends and family with, and you NO LONGER get to be friends or family with those people moving forward.\n\nThe only way its going to affect your family is if you and your ex allow it to.  It will never be because they heard someone be racist, it will be because they heard someone be racist and you didn't do anything about it.  Thats how they will learn that.\n\nAlso, I am a co-parent of a cheating exwife as well bud, Its been a decade, he will never know she cheated on me, why would he need to know that?  How would your boys ever know your family was \"Broken up\" if thats not the narrative you present to them.\n\nMy ex didn't cheat on my son, she cheated on me, she is a good mom, she loves the kid, so he will never need to know why we didn't stay together, its irrelevant.  \n\nAll of my family knows they don't ever get to say shit, because I made it clear I am not a shit slinging asshole.  The kid comes first, and that means my ex and I are a united front, and co-parents.  So no one will be saying a negative thing about my kids mom.  We had our issues and we split and the reason is no ones business.\n\nI cut out ANY family and friends that spoke ill of his mother.  ZERO TOLERANCE.  \n\nThe kids should never pay a price for your wifes mistakes.  If you co parent properly there is no issues with the kid.  Like I said we split when he was 2, he is almost 11 now and he is a well adjusted kid who knows both is parents love him, we just aren't together.  \n\nHe will never know she cheated, its irrelevant.  Same with your situation.  When they get older will they put 2 and 2 together?  Maybe, but you don't have to go into detail about it.  \n\nIn the end like I said, the only way your kids will be influence by racism is if you tolerate racism.  If you ONLY call out racist comments, and racist attitudes and show your kids that shit isn't ok, then they are never going to think its ok.\n\nSo you are gonna lose a few friends, and maybe family and they will be racists and not worthwhile anyways.  Your ex and you have to deal with shit a couple white folks usually ignore and don't deal with and you don't get to do that anymore.  Now you have to be vocal allies and call it out EVERYTIME and set that example."

        "content": "Everybody works for somebody; we all know who Donald works for now.   There is no benefit for him in this behavior because it doesn’t help his base or his donors, so he must owe Putin big time for something else.  He’s been funded by Russian money since 1984: \n\n\nTrump was over a billion in debt and the Russians bailed him out.\n\n► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money. In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\n\n► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, Apr 30, 1992)\n\n► Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\n\n► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n\n► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.\n\n► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.\n\n► From Craig Unger's AMA: \"Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.\"\n\n►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was living at Trump Tower\n\n► According to a Bloomberg investigation (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”\n\n► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.\n\n► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n\n►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n\n► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.\n\n► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\"\n\n► Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”\n\n► Russian oligarchs co-signed Trump’s Deutsche bank loans.\n\nTrump now gleefully takes cues from Putin:\n\n► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a strong push for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on January 2nd, Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n► Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. \"I don't care, I believe Putin\"\n\n► Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.\n\n► Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.\n\n► He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events.\n\n► Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies.\n\n► Demanded Russia get invited back into G7\n\n► Pushed the CIA to give American intelligence to the Kremlin.\n\n► Withdrew from the Open Skies treaty\n\n► Received intelligence in 2019 that Russia was paying bounties for dead American soldiers, and hasn't done anything about it by the time of this writing.\n\n► Announced troop withdrawal from Germany (America's missile defense from Russia and forward operating base against Russian aggression)\n\n► And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power."

Jokes aside CSS stands for cascading style sheets, and it's what allows web developers to customize the appearance of their webpages.\n\n\n# Free\n\n[MDN (mozilla developer network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is THE resource for when it comes to anything web. That being said it's a massive resource not only covering CSS. Other topics include HTML, web standards, protocols, and the like. MDN mainly provides two types of resources. Tutorials and references. Their tutorials are great for beginners to learn the basics, and their references are great for experienced developers when they need a quick find. Looking to build a foundation for CSS? [Checkout their comprehensive guide on CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS). Want to learn something specific like CSS transform? [Checkout their page on transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform). Want to learn about anything web related? I'm sure MDN has written something about it.\n\n[CSS-Tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/) - CSS Tricks is another fantastic resource for CSS(and Design considerations). They have many in-depth guides you can see [here](https://css-tricks.com/guides/). Looking to learn something in particular like [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) or [CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)? Look no further. On top of being a great place to learn they also have a newsletter worth checking out. They're a high quality resource, and if you spend anytime doing front end development they're a resource that will pop up.\n\n[Marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io/) - Marksheet.io is a website that I recently came across. It popped up as I was refreshing my memory on CSS animation, transforms, and transitions. I found it very succinct and straight forward, also it provided good graphic illustrations that helped me visualize what was going on. I recommend it as a straight to the point no bullshit kind of resource.\n\n[Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/) - Interneting is hard aims to help beginners learn about HTML & CSS with an emphasis on design. One thing I love about it is it stresses the importance of writing code, and how that helps you understand what your doing. Internting Is Hard is a detailed and hands on resource. If you like getting your hands dirty and really seeing how things work this is a great place to start.\n\n# Paid\n\n[CSS Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Essential-Training/5038219-2.html) - This video course is available on lynda, and aimed at teaching the basics of CSS. I think it's a great CSS 101 resource, and it's the one I used when I started learning about CSS.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nIn my experience CSS is one of those things that's conceptually easy to understand, but a bit difficult to put into practice. Many people (including myself) who understanding CSS still need to experiment with it to get the designs they wish. The takeaway here is CSS is something that you need to practice repeatedly to be able to use effectively. \n\nIf your looking to build a foundation on which you can logically use CSS in your own work then take a look at these resources\n\n* Interneting is Hard\n* CSS Essential Training\n* Marksheet.io\n* MDN (their css tutorial)\n\nIf you already know CSS then you're familiar with how difficult it can be at times. I recommend the following resources for when you need a reference or are trying to learn something new\n\n* MDN\n* CSS-Tricks.com\n* Also, the other resources if they cover a specific topic your looking for.\n\n\n\nThat's all! If you enjoyed this article there's more coming! Every week I write about topics in CS & programming, and give guidance on learning them.

        "content": ">Senior developers, on the other hand, just make problems disappear. They reduce stress. **They hit deadlines**.\n\nI've really found the opposite to be true. Senior developers know that deadlines are often arbitrary and can be moved whereas quality is hard to fix afterwards. So when you have to choose between doing something quickly and doing it well you accept the inconvenience of telling your PM you're not done yet, and do what's best in the long term.\n\nJunior developers are more scared of missing the deadline and rush through shortcuts to finish on time. That shifts cost to the QA phase (or worse, support issues with customers) and in the end you probably spend more time than you would have if you did it right."

        "content": "**So hashes and timestamps are used to make it very hard to inject fake blocks in to this chain and the guessing of the lucky number has to do with these hashes?**\n\nYes, the lucky number that the miners are trying to guess depends on what is in the previous block. This way they can't cheat by guessing for the lucky numbers before the other miners. Every time the lucky number is guessed a miner creates a new block full of transaction that then all the other miners can verify as valid, the miners then take the data from this block as the start of a new race for every miner to find the next lucky number. \n\n**So miners are in a race to try to find a random number to satisfy a calculation and when they find this they then let all the other miners know and those miners can quickly verify the calculation?**\n\nCorrect, but you can't take the calculation itself and try to extract the number out of it because this is again a form of a one way function. You have to try until you get lucky or until ll you have tried everything. But when you find it's very easy to see that it's correct. \n\n**And trying everything takes a long time?**\n\nYes and this is where difficulty becomes a factor! \n\n**Yes you said difficulty determined how hard or easy it will be to guess correctly because a higher difficulty means they have to make more guesses to find the lucky number and less guesses when the diffuculty is lower.**\n\n\nRemember how I talked about the reward that bitcoin miners get because they get to include the first transaction in a block by giving coins to themselves?\n\n**Yes, this is why miners mine bitcoin because they want to shout to everybody in the network the first valid block because if there block is the first valid block then in that block is a transaction to one of their addresses and so now they have more coins!**\n\nYes but we need to regulate this process.\n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause this way we can regulate how fast new coins are being created. We want new coins to be created every 10 minutes and every 4 years we want the amount of coins you get for solving a block to go down. \n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause Bitcoin was designed in such a way that there can never be more than 21 million Bitcoins.\n\n**Oh but that means that there can not be more then 21 million Bitcoin users because they would all have one bitcoin**\n\nNo, because one Bitcoin we can divide a single Bitcoin in to a 100 000 000 little cents.  We call one of these cents a satoshi or sat for short.\n\n**So why does have Bitcoin a limit of 21 million?**\n\nBecause this will artificially give Bitcoin the properties of being scarce, that means that if 21 million people all want to have a full Bitcoin that will probably never happen. And so people might be willing to pay a lot of money for a bitcoin, because they are so scarce. \n\n**Kind of like gold?**\n\nYes but don't compare bitcoin one on one with gold, that does not work. We will come back to that later.\n\nSo Satoshi thought that creating a limit to the amount of bitcoins that can exist in the network would give Bitcoin a property that we call \"deflationary\". It's a very stupid term because it should have been called inflationary, but smart people always like to make things complicated. What it means is this: \n\nWhen in our current financial system everything you can buy become more expensive we call this inflation. You could also say that our money is becoming less valuable because you can now buy less with the same amount of money then before.\n\nThe opposite of this is deflation, where products in the stores become cheaper. You could say that your money is becoming more valuable because you can now buy more with it then before. \n\nOur current financial systems have mechanism that allow it for somewhat control inflation and deflation.\n\nSatoshi though that it would be good if Bitcoin would be deflationary in nature. \n\n**Okay so that means that bitcoins will become more valuable towards the future is that because of the 21 million limit?** \n\nNo, the 21 million limit only gives it the property of scarcity but a fixed limit makes it very hard for somebody to control the amount of inflation and deflation.  \n\n**So how did Satoshi make Bitcoin deflationary?**\n\nHe did so buy a mechanism that will bring less and less Bitcoin in circulation as time goes by.\n\nRemember when I told you that when a miner finds the lucky number and makes a block that he get's some Bitcoin as a reward?\n\n**Yes**\n\nWell when Bitcoin started the first 4 years this number was 50 Bitcoin. The second four years this number was 25 Bitcoins. Every 4 years this number goes in half. If we plot that over time, it means that only 21 million bitcoin will ever be mined and that the last Bitcoin will be mined somewhere in 2140. \n\n**And that is a mechanism for deflation?**\n\nYes because every 4 years the supply of newly mined Bitcoin will be cut in half. When the supply goes down and the demand stays the same the price goes up. This is why Bitcoin is deflationary by design. \n\nNow remember when I said that the time between two blocks is roughly 10 minutes?"

        "content": "**Oh so this means the miners can cheat**\n\nNo, because miners can make as many blocks as they want and they can put in those  blocks whatever they want but remember, only one block makes it in to the chain! \n\n**Okay so the miners are in a race ... to make not just any blocks, but the first ... valid block that will become the next block in the chain?**\n\nYes correct, see when the miners are putting all these transactions that they heard people shout in to a block they have to also guess the correct number. The first one to guess the correct number can then take all these transactions and start with his own transaction where he magically creates these coins for himself. The miner then shouts the lucky number to all the other miners. \n\n**So the miners are constantly listening for transactions, trying to make blocks out of transactions but a valid block is a block that included the correct number? What do you mean by guessing the correct number?**\n\nGuessing the correct number is the essence of bitcoin mining. Again it works because of this mathematical function that is hard in one way and easy in the other way. Remember that private key and public key thing? Anybody can easily verify this even with a potato computer but if you want to cheat you have but one option: Guess a trillion billion times untill you get lucky. After every guess you need to verify and see if you guessed correctly.  Bitcoin mining does this but with a twist. \n\n**Tell me about the twist! This is so damn interesting**\n\nYeah welcome to the club pall,  see if I make you guess between 1 and 10 it won't take long before you say the number that I had in mind. If I make you guess between 1 and a million this is a different story. Bitcoin controls how large the range of numbers is. If a miner needs to guess between 1 and 10 this is called a very low diffuculty. If a miner needs to guess between 1 and 1000 000 this is called a very high difficulty.  But we will come back to this later. For now you should take from this that the reason why Bitcoin mining is so resource intensive and why it uses so much electricity is that bitcoin mining is the collective guessing of an entire machine of networks all trying to get lucky. \n\n\n**Okay let's go back to transactions then. Bitcoin minining is taking transaction to build blocks with  but only the block build with the lucky number will be seen as valid by the other miners and make it in to the blockchain?\"**\n\n\n\nYes, and so when the other miners hear you shout your block with the correct lucky number they can verify it very easily, they then say to themselves: Oh boy I better stop making my own block, my block did not win the race, I did not get lucky, this guy his block won the race. Let's take this guy his block and build upon that block. \n\n**Ah so all the miners are in a race to create the first valid block and whatever miner creates the first valid block is rewarded with coins and that block becomes the latest block in this block chain and then everything starts all over?**\n\nYes and this process can be verified by everybody because of how smart Satoshi was. Hey congratulations, we are not even half way there and already you have more knowledge of bitcoin then 90% of everybody that has ever bought bitcoin. \n\n**Tell me more!**\n\nSee these block form a chain because every block makes a reference to the block before it. These references work because of timestamps and hashes. This means that each block sets a precedence for what is the next valid block and at the same time strengthens the validity of every block under it. This is why committing fraud in the blockchain is very very hard but more about that later. \n\n**What is a timestamp?**\n\nSatoshi writes:\n\n>A timestamp server works by taking a\nhash   of   a   block   of   items   to   be   timestamped   and   widely   publishing   the   hash,   such   as   in   a\nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5].   The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the\ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in\nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\n\n**Then what is a hash?**\n\nRember when we where talking about mathematical functions that are hard in one direction but easy in the other? This makes it possible to have system where verifying is very easy, it might take 500 nano seconds for a computer to verify. But it makes it hard to cheat, it might take 500 years for a computer to calculate in the other direction because it can only make a guess, check it if it's not correct make another guess and check that... until it accidentally guesses correctly which can take very long when the range of numbers is big enough.  \n\n**So a hash is like that?**\n\nYes a hash is a one way function of a bunch of data.  Let's take some made up data like this \n\nwetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72\n\nThe hash of this might be 4390AC\n\nDo you see something peculiar? The hash is much shorter then the data. Now with a hash function it's  going to be very easy for a computer to take wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72 and calculate  4390AC but IMPOSSIBLE to take 4390AC and turn tthat in to wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72\n\n**Impossible?**\n\nYes impossible because 4390AC might also be a valid hash for \n\niunhgewir2898ughi34utn28oui2nom3ruy23nri23hr2uyirj2h8o3rh238r7238r723r872h3r872gr7823rh8238rh283hr\n\nand for \n\n23948y2h83ri2h 3brnhuijn4ge8urgbnwiogh2u3igo2guyig2u3hig2jh3uygi2j4gh2uighj4iugyi2jugh2uy3igh2u83ighj2i\n\n\n**Are you trying to say that for a set of data there can only be one hash but for a hash there can be multiple sets of data that lead to that hash?**\n\nOf course, otherwise we could infinitely compress data because a hash can be calculated from a data set of ANY LENGHT while the hash will always be of the same length even if the data is just a single 0 or 1. \n\nIf I can turn 4390AC in to ONLY wetowiht923tr8gy2uir28gyuiq2o3rhbyuniqo2rgy1u3i09gw8bfhuaijofhgy61e48u92ygtf67yubh3wgyu2389tg72 I can also turn 4390AC  in to all possible data in the universe, which is logically impossible unless we live in a simulator and The Great Programmer accidentally disables the logic service. \n\n**Okay you are starting to loose me, can we come back to this later?**\n\nI will do my best. \n\n\n**Okay so what is Satoshi speaking about when he talk about timestamp and hashes?**\n\nLet's go back to our block of chains. In order to prevent cheating these blocks contain references to each other in the form of hashes of timestamps. Why? Because then a  block can prove that it was build upon a previous block because these blocks include a timestamp and a hash of the timestamp of the previous block. See if then you want to create false block you need to solve a one way function in the other direction and that is very hard because the only way to do it is to guess and hope you get lucky or improve your odds by guessing faster or make more guesses as the same time. \n\n**Okay so these blocks link to each other in such a way that injecting something fake in to this link is very hard to do with a computer?**\n\nCorrect! You should be explaining this to me, at least you keep it short and simple! \n\n**So what about his puzzle that  the miners are trying to solve in order to build the first valid new block and get the coin reward?**\n\nSatoshi writes: \n\n>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the\nhash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number\nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the\nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.   Once the CPU\neffort   has   been   expended   to   make   it   satisfy   the   proof-of-work,   the   block   cannot   be   changed\nwithout  redoing  the   work.    As   later   blocks   are  chained   after  it,   the  work  to  change  the  block\nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\n\nSo here is how that works. When miners want to create the first valid new block they first take a bit of data from the previous block, the block they want to build upon. They then try to find a hash of that data that starts with a number of zeros. This is that guessing and the lucky number that we talked about before. It is now time to introduce a new term: the nonce. \n\nRemember the guessing the miners do and the lucky number? \n\n**Yes from like 30 paragraphs before ... now wait a minute who decided on what the lucky number is that the miners try to guess? How can they guess a correct number that everybody is trying to find and nobody knows?**\n\nThis is where hashes and the nonce come together and create the working mechanism. \n\n**I am feeling a slight headache, is that the price of enlightenment?**\n\nDon't interrupt me so much. \n\n**Sorry, continue please I want to understand**"

        "content": "So this big book with a bunch of account numbers on them is in bitcoin called the blockchain. Bitcoin mining is the group process of working on this blockchain. \n\n**Why do we need to work on the blockchain?**\n\nBecause people like to make bitcoin transactions and then this big book with all the account numbers and balance in them needs to be updated. We are now going to refer to this big book with all the account numbers and balances as the blockchain. \n\n**Okay tell me more about the blockchain, is it a chain of blocks?**\n\nCorrect! Satoshi writes\n\n>We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the\nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner\nand adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of\nownership.\n\n**But I want to know what bitcoin mining is, you said that miners together work on the blockchain?**\n\nYes, when people want to make a bitcoin transaction they shout to the internet:\n\nHey Bitcoin network: I am address number 5 and  I would like to send 4 coins from my address  number 5 to  address number 6. Everybody on the network then repeats this shout. \n\n**Yeah but anybody can say anything on the internet, how do we know if you are truly the owner of address number 5 and how do we know if you actually have 4 coins?** \n\nBecause when you shout at the bitcoin network you need to sign that shout with a secret key, one that only you have!\n\n**But if I shout the secret key then everybody will have the secret key!**\n\nThat's why you don't shout the secret key, you take the public key and do some mathematical magic with your private key and then the result of that you shout to the bitcoin network. \n\n**Okay so with bitcoin there is a private key and a public key. I guess that the public key is public and the private key needs to stay a secret? So you never actually shout the private key, you use the private key to do some mathematical magic and then shout the result to the network?**\n\nYes, lets go back to our example: \n\n>Hey Bitcoin network: I am address number 5 and  I would like to send 4 coins from my address  number 5 to  address number 6. \n\nWhat do Bitcoin miners do when they receive this transaction? First they need to know if you are the owner of address number 5. They can easily do this because you have done a mathematical operation that nobody can do expect the one that own the secret key that is linked to that address number 5. So they know that you are truly the owner of address number 5. Now they need to know if you really have 4 coins to give to address number 5. Since the  blockchain is this chain of blocks and since blocks are just a bunch of transactions this is easy. They traceback in to the blockchain and they go over all the coins that number 4 has ever received and all the transactions that number 4 has ever send. If the difference between in and out is bigger then 4 that means that address number 5 has the coins. \n\n**So miners can check if a transaction is valid by going through the blockchain to figure out if the  coins are there and they can figure out if you are truly the owner of those coins by looking at a mathematical function that only the owner of number 5 can do  proofing he has the secret key, also called the private key?**\n\nCorrect! So now that the transaction is valid, it needs to be written down in the blockchain! But what miner is going to be the one that writes this down in the blockchain? All of them? \n\n**Yes, I would like to know this! Bye the way you are explaining this greatly!**\n\nSee now we are getting to the essence of bitcoin mining. When you shout your transaction to the bitcoin network you are not the only one. Other people are shouting transactions too. This is the start of a race! \n\n**A race between  bitcoin miners?**\n\nYes, they want to take all these transactions and put them in a  block, and then take the chain of blocks and build that new block on top of that chain!\n\n**So it's a race to build block on top of the blockchain?**\n\nCorrect! See not every block that the miners are building will make it to the chain. There can only be one! \n\n**How does  that work, by the way why are these bitcoin miners doing this. Are they just nice people?**\n\nThey might be nice people, but they are doing this because if they can win this block building race with the other miners they get some free coins for it! \n\n**Free coins! I want some free coins too! But how does this work?**\n\n\n\nWell then you need to become a bitcoin miner. These free (they still cost electricity though, later more) coins work like this: All these miners are building their  blocks. They take all the transaction that are valid and they build this block, but in the first line of this block they write a special kind of transaction. They write transaction that does not have a previous input! \n\n**You mean like coins that did not previously exist in this great book full of accounts and transactions between these accounts?**\n\nYes, this is the magical process of how bitcoins are created. The first transaction of every block is a miner giving coins to himself!"

        "content": "When computer networks became a thing there was one big unsolved problem. How do you make the operators of those computers work together in a network without having to trust them and without somebody being able to cheat? \n\nSo two types of networks became possible\n\n1) Centralized networks where access  is not open and you need to trust each participant but they can't cheat cause you know who they are and they would loose access if they try to cheat. You need a central place to keep track of this, that's why they are centralized. \n\n2) Decentralized networks where access is open and where you don't know your participants but where it's possible for those participants to cheat. For example people that download over bittorrent but never upload. If everybody would do this, bittorrent would not work. Decentralized networks make it possible to cooperate without having to trust anybody but it's hard to protect from people abusing the network. \n\nThe current financial networks of banks working together is a network of type 1. The current internet is a type 1 network. Big service providers connect their networks with other big service providers but if they would start cheating, you know who they are and you can disconnect them. You have many type 2 networks on the internet but they are build upon the physical infrastructure of the internet, which is a type 1 network. \n\nA type 2 financial network was never possible because what if people are not honest and start cheating, when it comes to the flow of data on the internet  or people that download over bittorent but never upload this is one thing but what about money?  Money is serious business! \n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was the first person (or group) that came up with a practical solution to this problem. This is what he wrote in his [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)\n\n>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as\ntrusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for\nmost   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.\nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot\navoid   mediating   disputes.  \n\n\n\n>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,\nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted\nthird  party.    Transactions  that  are  computationally  impractical  to   reverse   would  protect  sellers\nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In\nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed\ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The\nsystem   is   secure   as   long   as   honest   nodes   collectively   control   more   CPU   power   than   any\ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\n\n\nSatoshi then describes a genius mechanism where cheating in this network is only possible when you have more then half the processing power of that network but where it will always be more interesting for you to join that network with your power instead of attacking it. Think about it, if you invest a 100 million dollars to make enough special hardware so you control 51% of the bitcoin network and then you use that hardware to destroy the network you have just invested a 100 million dollars in to hardware you have just made obsolete yourself. Well done, your investors won't be happy. You have just played yourself. \n\nHere is what Satoshi writes: \n\n>By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned\nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides\na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.\nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending\nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of\nthe   block   containing   the   transaction.     Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation\nfree.\nThe   incentive   may   help   encourage   nodes   to   stay   honest.     If   a   greedy   attacker   is   able   to\nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it\nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to\nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than\neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n\n**So what is this mechanism that Satoshi invented?** \n\nSatoshi writes: \n\n>We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.  We started with\nthe   usual   framework   of   coins   made   from   digital   signatures,   which   provides   strong   control   of\nownership,   but   is   incomplete   without   a   way   to   prevent   double-spending.     To   solve   this,   we\nproposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions\nthat   quickly   becomes   computationally   impractical   for   an   attacker   to   change   if   honest   nodes\ncontrol a majority of CPU power.   The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.   Nodes\nwork all at once with little coordination.   They do not need to be identified, since messages are\nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can\nleave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   proof-of-work   chain   as   proof   of   what\nhappened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of\nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on\nthem.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism\n\n\n**So what is proof of work?** \n\nSatoshi writes: \n\n\n>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the\nhash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number\nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the\nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.   Once the CPU\neffort   has   been   expended   to   make   it   satisfy   the   proof-of-work,   the   block   cannot   be   changed\nwithout  redoing  the   work.    As   later   blocks   are  chained   after  it,   the  work  to  change  the  block\nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision\nmaking.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone\nable   to   allocate   many   IPs.     Proof-of-work   is   essentially   one-CPU-one-vote.     The   majority\ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested\nin it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the\nfastest and outpace any competing chains.   To modify a past block, an attacker would have to\nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the\nwork of the honest nodes.  \n\n**So what does that all mean, explain it to me like I am five!** \n\nBitcoin is a big book full of bank accounts that only have a number but not a name. Under every bank account entry it simply lists how many coins have gone in and out of this bank account  number and to which  bank account number these coins have. To find out the balance of a number we just calculate all the coins in and out of a  bank account number and what is left is the balance on this bank account number. \n\n**Ah I get it now, but what if somebody tries to change the big book and cheat and give himself more coins?**\n\nWe make sure that everybody has a copy of  this book, that way if somebody tries to cheat we compare his book with all the other books, if one is different then we say: get out you cheater! \n\n\n**Okay so everybody has a copy of this book but then how do you keep everything in sync?**\n\nWe make sure that the book is one long chain where everything that we ad to the book we ad by linking it to what is already in the book. Every time somebody does a transaction we tell that to everybody and everybody repeats it to everybody. \n\n**Ah I see, you just build together with a whole bunch of people on that what is already established**\n\nCorrect! \n\n**But that will lead to chaos! What if some people build on this and some people build on that, you might not end up with 10 000 different versions of the book but maybe you end up with 10 different versions of the book?**\n\n\nThis is where mathematics start playing a role. Within mathematics it's possible to have a function that is easy in one direction but hard in the other direction. I don't have time to explain all of that, it's basically the essence of cryptography where you have a public and a private key. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko62sibi668) uses the mixing of colors as an example of explaining modular arithmetic (clock arithmetic) \n\nSee next post for the rest."

        "content": "Oh no worries. \n\nIt would just be the standard deviation of the numbers, and the median. Larger means a less equal distribution. I’ll do some examples based on the above numbers. \n\nExample1:\n>\t1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nSum = 27. Median = 1. STDev = 2.5. Mean = 3.\n\nSo the mean, as you know, is a terrible metric of wealth distribution. The median at least helps remove the huge outliers which can make it look like the “man in the middle” receives a larger cut than they do in reality, due to people like Bezos etc. \n\nBut the median still doesn’t tell you a lot about the distribution itself. The standard deviation can. Using the same total (27) over 9 people we can give two examples showing why median + STDev is useful. \n\nExample 2:\n>\t3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3\n\nSum = 27. Median = 3. STDev = 0. Mean = 3.\n\nHere we have perfectly equal distribution of wealth, so the STDev is 0; metrically it’s easy to see from the STDev that the distribution is more “equal” at 0, than the 2.5 above. \n\nFinally.\nExample 3:\n>\t1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 19\n\nSum = 27. Median = 1. STDev = 6. Mean = 3.\n\nSo you can see that for Ex1, and Ex3, the median is the same, at 1. Suggesting that the “man in the middle” is equal in both examples. Also see that all 3 examples have a mean of 3, so you could expect equal distribution of wealth. But the differences in the STDev are stark from 0, to 2.5, to 6.\n\nSo median(STDev) tells you 1) what the “man in the middle” is doing and 2) how evenly the wealth is distributed. Higher numbers represent greater wealth inequality. \n\n(Bonus) Example 4:\n>\t0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 19\n\nSum = 27. Median = 1. STDev = 6.2. Mean = 3.\n\nI think this example is probably the closest to, if not the American reality, certainly something close to the global reality. Again, the median and mean here don’t report the horrible reality where 44% of our people have 0% of the wealth (0, 0, 0, 0), a further 33% control only 11% (1, 1, 1) and the last 22% of the people control 83% (5, 19) of the total. \n\nOr put worse, the bottom 78% have 10% of the wealth; the ‘middle’ 11% has 19%; and the very top 11% has 70% of everything (ignore that 10+19+70 = 99%, it’s just a rounding error for easy reading)."

        "content": "VeritasLuxMea, means well, but unfortunately appears to know very little about this. \n\nThere's no such thing as a \"shader\" when it comes to hardware.  A shader is graphics API terminology for a program that runs on the GPU.  Today there's an artificial distinction between a \"kernel\" and a \"shader\", with shader not having access to normal pointer arithmetic, and some other limitations, and kernel being relegated to just the compute space (though you still have \"compute shaders\", and compute shaders end up being the same compiled assembly you would have seen with kernels, hence why I say it is artificial). \n\nWhat they are confused about is the terminology \"Shader Core\".  This is a generalized terminology for either Cuda Cores or the \"cores\"/lanes inside of compute units on AMD side, sometimes media refers to the individual lanes inside the compute units as compute units on AMD, but AMD's compute units are actually akin to [NVidia's Streaming Multiprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_\\(microarchitecture\\)#Streaming_Multiprocessor_%22Pascal%22) (SM).   Shader Core corresponds to Cuda core on the chart above. \n\nA Cuda core is simply a lane in an [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) unit, typically refered to as a [\"Warp\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_block_\\(CUDA_programming\\)#Warps) on the Nvidia side ([Wavefront on AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next#Wavefront), and historically in parallel processing academia).  This warp processes 32 arithmetic operations at the same time, but unlike on CPU [SIMD analogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions), each lane in the warp has it's own register space associated with it, as well as other specialized SIMD per lane functions.  Think of these as a bunch of 32bit floating point units that operate in lock step. \n\nIf you double the amount of cuda cores, you double the amount of arithmetic throughput. *Effectively* doubling the amount of cuda cores doubles the speed of your graphics card.  But there's more to your FPS than just floating point speed, and it's game dependent. \n\nCUDA cores have little *specifically* to do with rasterization.  They are used in *every* part of rendering.  They do the bulk of the GPU work in general.  Rasterization typically uses Cuda cores in the vertex shader which generates vertices to draw, then those vertices are sent off to a hardware triangle fragment generation unit, which typically is a per SM or per multiple SM thing, but it really depends on the architecture.  Point is, it is a separate piece of hardware not related to Cuda cores.  The hardware geometry unit generates things called \"fragment\" which are like pixels where triangles were drawn.  These aren't just pixels, because they don't necessarily correspond 1:1 to a screen window, and aren't actually drawn until the end of your *fragment shader's* execution.  When you perform transparent triangle rasterization, you'll have multiple fragments in the same \"pixel\" space.  You also don't have to render to a \"screen\", you can render to any old framebuffer.   You can think of Cuda cores as running for each pixel, though I believe they actually operate over a 2x2 fragments.  Here they read from textures to color the fragment, perform special post processing effects, or any number of things.\n\nCUDA cores are even used in raytracing, RT cores figure out with what and where the rays bounced, CUDA cores effectively fill the same job they did before with the rasterization pipeline, but instead of fragments generated from triangles, they operate on fragments generated from ray intersections. \n\nCUDA cores are just the main method to do arithmetic on the GPU.  \n\nThese SIMD lanes are called CUDA cores because of marketing, they reference the [CUDA GPU Compute API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)."

Close with a sentence about why you think you’re the best for the job.  \n  \n>  \n>A paragraph or two elaborating on relevant things listed in your resume that make you good for the job. Frex, if applying for a job as a dog walker, talking about volunteer work at the SPCA, or the fact that you have two big dogs that you walk at home regularly.   \n>  \n>A closing paragraph, summarizing why you are the best candidate for the job and expressing your desire for it.  \n>  \n>A tailing sentence saying “I look forward to hearing from you.” or something of the sort.  \n  \n>  \n>Your closing salutation  \n>  \n>In general: Be confident, bordering on arrogant. If you’ve ever watched “Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog,” be Captain Hammer in your attitude. I’m the best, of course you’ll hire me because I’m the best, any other choice would be silly. Don’t say any of that in so many words, but that’s the kind of attitude you want to project - if you have any doubts about the job or your own abilities, the cover letter is not the place to express them.   \n  \n>  \n>If you’re not naturally arrogant (hi), you will probably feel ***really uncomfortable*** in writing and sending it. That’s fine. A well-written cover letter should be able to convince even your worst critic, yourself, that you’re probably a good fit for the job.   \n  \n>  \n>EDIT: Note also that adding personal touches, like “I love animals” or talking about hobbies that are relevant, is fine in a cover letter. Keep it professional - a potential boss does not need to know about your Loki cosplay unless you’re applying for a drama or costume making position or something of the sort - but don’t be afraid to crack a joke or add something that sets you apart from other people. Frex, if applying for an electrical internship, talking about how your parents used to have to hide the remotes because you’d always take them apart to see how they worked would be a good personal touch to add, humanizing you while illustrating that you’ve been passionate about the field since childhood. \n\nEdit from me: thank you for the awards, folks!

It probably comes from the fact that a normal person is likely to have that sort of critique. Plenty of people criticize the purpose, morality, and efficacy of American military interventions abroad. That's a normal part of discourse in this country and have been since the early days of the Republic. Trump got a real pass from people who simply assumed that this is what he was talking about the whole time.\n\nBut Trump has no policy critiques because he doesn't even comprehend things on that level. He's not arguing whether patriotism is a worthwhile value to espouse, he's not sure what that word even means. He's only able to pantomime the values of others. His critique on our involvement in Iraq, likewise, has always been that it went wrong - because he wasn't the one in charge. He has, obviously, no problem with American foreign intervention save for the part where he's not involved. For all of the anti-war people who somehow decided that Trump was somehow a voice of reason - the unsaid half was always that he was anti-war when it doesn't involve his direct leadership. Plainly, he happily will send troops to their deaths, frequently on arbitrary whims and pointless exercises, as long as he's in charge. Because he has no innate sense of morality or principles he's not above defending any value society at large finds repugnant, because he doesn't understand that feeling of repugnance. He praises Nazis, white supremacists, and terrorists because, in almost self-parody, he literally thinks they did nothing wrong.\n\nAnd this sort of stunted moral compass is such an aberration that a significant chunk of Americans are simply in denial that any person can be like that at all. That, and an exaggerated, practiced pantomime act he spent his life using and reusing, means that unless you are able accept the notion that he is so aberrant that your heuristics in evaluating someone's values in relations to your own is entirely erased so you can look at a person completely as a blank slate, there's almost no way to fit what Donald Trump actually is into anyone's normal moral framework. And so many simply give him a pass and pretend like he's talking about what a normal person is talking about in the context. That is, as it turns out, almost never the case. He is actually supporting neo-Nazis who happen to vote for him, like how he is actually talking about wanting to fuck his daughter, like how he actually does not understand the debate on America's role in the world. We let him onto the adults table, but he's only having kids table conversations, and can only kids table conversations because it's all he can understand."

A form factor that fits into a slot on the motherboard and one that is 22mm in width and 40/60/80/110mm in length. A drive that comes in this form factor can either use the SATA or the NVMe protocol/interface to read and write data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNVMe on the other hand refers to a drive that is capable of using PCIe's parallelism in order to read and write data at way higher speeds than ~~SATA~~ AHCI is capable of. Such drives don't have to come in an M.2 form factor though. They can also come in a 2.5\" form factor and are then called \"U.2\" drives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: made a mistake in the first sentence of the last paragraph.\n\nThis should've either been \"a SATA SSD\" or \"AHCI\". The latter would be the opposite of/counterpart to NVMe. Thank you to u/milkysniper and u/counters14 for correcting me!"

The more you got going on in your life, the less you will be thinking of this stuff. Here are a few things that helped me:\n\n1) Accept the fact that putting women on pedestals never works out and move on from those you’re doing it to. Why? Because when you put someone on a pedestal, the only way they can see you is by looking down on you. Once you’ve done that, proceed to the second thing. \n\n2) Realize that they are not responsible for your happiness. YOU are responsible for YOUR happiness. Focus on yourself first and foremost on what you want to accomplish that would make you happy that isn’t dating related. Mine was simple: go to the gym and bulk up. Everything else was secondary (except crushing it at work of course). Don’t view women as the gateway to your happiness. \n\n3) If you haven’t already shot your shot with this girl you like, and it wouldn’t be beyond creepy if you messaged them, try to set up plans. That way, you know where you stand and can move on if they don’t want to hang out or keep pretending to be busy, forever. Rejection is better than regret. That said, if you cannot do that, take that as an auto rejection and move on to what you can control in your life. \n\nIt takes a while to lose this mentality you have. However, it feels amazing when you break out of it."

In China, the process did not involve mass privatization. SOEs maintained its dominant role in the industrial sector. Through this cautious and gradual approach, these economies have been able to replace the traditional Soviet-type system with a market system meanwhile maintaining remarkable records of growth and price stability during the transition process.\n\nSummary of Lin's advice for other countries:\n\n>First, the government can take measures to improve the micro incentives by granting partial managerial autonomy and profit-sharing to the micro units so as to increase incentives and to allow the economy to move closer to the production frontier. The government should encourage local and private initiatives in institutional innovations in this stage.   \n>  \n>Second, the government can introduce a dual-track price and allocation system allowing the resources to be allocated increasingly by the micro units to the previously suppressed, more productive sectors, while maintaining the normal production of the SOEs.  \n>  \n>Third, the government can liberalize the price when the commodity is largely allocated by the market track.   \n>  \n>Fourth, the government gradually introduces and strengthens the necessary market institutions during the above process.\n\nChina had a host of other unique characteristics, such as:\n\n* a much poorer, agricultural population, well-suited to labor-intensive industries,\n* a surplus of working-age labor right at the time of reform (1970s-1990s),\n* a relatively educated workforce, in terms of literacy etc., especially compared with its level of development (which was absolute abject poverty),\n* geographic proximity to other industrialized/industrializing economies, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, right as they're shedding their labor-intensive manufacturing,\n* cultural proximity to wealthy ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs willing to invest in China,\n* a long coastline with many harbors conducive to shipping,\n* political stability,\n* relative geopolitical friendliness from the west, from the 70s all the way until 2016, when Trump was elected,\n* a government open to reforms and less rent-seeking than many others."

I may even make a couple of mistakes while speaking to recruiters or during initial phone screens at first, so I organize companies into 3 groups (not super interesting, would settle for, and favorites) and start by applying to the companies I'm not very interested in. Before each interview, I write down 3-5 questions I would ask assuming I have up to 25% of the interview for my own questions. During the interview, I take short notes (often when they're talking) like interviewer name, questions asked on both sides, interesting topics discussed, technologies mentioned, happy and sad faces about the experience or whatever. Afterwards, I expand on short notes, write down anything that went poorly, brush up on weak answers right away, and add to a list of weak topics to review before future interviews. I'll return to a given interview's notes any time I interview for that company again. Depending on the recruiter's style/instructions, I will probably email them to say how it went."

Your line manager being enthusiastic won't save you from the sack if you break something critical without having prior authorisation to do so\n\n2 - Make sure you follow change management processes (if you have any). Working in an organisation that has a mature CM framework and ignoring it is a CV-generating event\n\n3 - Use the free version of an off the shelf scanner like Nessus, make sure you aren't using destructive plugins, use non-credentialled scans to start with and work your way up to credentialled scans. Non-credentialled scans won't break anything that isn't already at serious risk of being broken (especially if its public-facing) but will at least find any gaping holes and demonstrate results before you move on to credentialled scans and potentially break something\n\n4 - Scan out of hours. This de-risks things to an extent (less people on the network means less chance of serious effects in the middle of people working). You still need to pay attention though - in case something breaks and you're not aware of it until the morning\n\n5 - Tell your monitoring and firewall/IPS teams. Nobody will thank you if they get paged at 2 AM because the IPS is lit up like a Christmas tree whilst Nessus blithely smashes away at your core servers :)\n\n6 - Collate your results into a coherent report. Most of the 'cooler' vulnerability management stuff won't be available to you without a paid version of whatever tool you're using, so pull everything together into a spreadsheet and make some cool charts (most vulnerable servers, highest risk vulnerabilities, most widespread vulnerabilities across the estate etc)\n\n7 - At some point, mention the need for a proper pen test, and suggest that you get involved in that. Recruit a pen test company and develop a framework for it in your organisation, get budget for it, and learn alongside whatever consultant they send\n\nGood luck!"

        "content": "I'm a Data Engineering manager at a start up, here are the things I'd look for when evaluating someone's Python skills: \n\n\\- Real world production projects with a business impact. This is the most important thing you can do. There's a lot of OSS and side project folks who can write some Python to do something, but it's a different ballgame to deal with the lifecycle of putting some into production and having to maintain something other people rely on.  I like to see the business impact of the work they did, because I look for developers who think beyond the code. \n\n\\- Barring that, OSS projects/Hackathons/Research, etc... I think every dev should do some of these, but I think having some valuable projects (e.g. beyond \"I followed a tutorial to build this thing) that they can speak to is a good mark. I also love being able to see how you would design and code a project if you had full design control over it. \n\nIn general, some concepts to know and get familiar with: \n\n\\- Pandas/Numpy: get good at these, there's a lot of flexibility for analytics and because they are written to interface with C-level code, they are going to be a lot faster when done correctly than something in pure Python. \n\n\\- Object-oriented approaches: Python has support for robust OOO using classes, you may prefer procedural or functional programming but OOO is still a dominant paradigm and you will need to be at least familiar with the base concepts and how to interact with code written using those approaches. \n\n\\- Multiprocessing: People say Python doesn't scale. They are morons. Learn how to write multiproccessed code to leverage multiple cores and scale. I can't tell you the number of times I've \"fixed\" performance/scaling issues in other people's code by just rewriting a big for loop to utilize multiprocessing. \n\n\\- Error handling: Dear lord, learn how to leverage error handling and use try/except blocks effectively. Even if you are writing procedural code, use try/catch to prevent your code from being flaky. \n\n\\- Testing: WRITE TESTS. Get comfortable with Pytest or Nose or another framework. I'm not saying you have to go deep into Test-Driven Development or anything, but learn how to write unit tests and get in the habit of doing them. Unit tests not only help to test your code, but they challenge you to be a better developer, because you start to write more atomic functions to make writing your tests easier. \n\n\\- Requests/APIs: Every developer in 2020 needs to be comfortable with interfacing with APIs. You'd be shocked at the number of folks who I've seen struggle with this. \n\n\\- Flask/Pyramid/Fast API/etc... One of the best ways to expose Python code is to wrap it in a simple REST API service. Learn how to do this quickly. This is important especially when you work with another development team in house. For example, my team uses Python and we expose most of our stuff as REST APIs with Swagger docs. Another dev team is Java, and we just swap API endpoints to interact with each other's processes. \n\n\\- Cloud deployment/scaling: You may be lucky enough to someday work in a shop with DevOps folks who are really comfortable with being fully responsible for maintaining scaling a deployment, and all you have to do is give them your code. Especially in small shops, this is likely not the case. Learn how to deploy on AWS/Azure/GCP, beyond just copying a python script to an EC2 instance. Become familiar with Lambda (serverless) Kube/ECS/Fargate (Containers), RDS/Aurora (database) and be comfortable deploying code to those approaches using their patterns to optimize and scale your code. \n\nAt the end of the day, Python is a \"full-spectrum\" language. As someone who wants to become a Python expert and do it professionally, especially since you are self-teaching, you are going to fight the notion that a new/Junior Python dev is just writing flaky procedural scripts. You can write great, hardened, scalable code in Python that rivals any other language, but I feel that due to Python being relatively easy to learn, there's a low barrier to entry, and it means that it's harder to assume a baseline level of CS knowledge that I'd look for in a developer that I would want to hire."

This leads to an *unrealistic* perception that other people's lives are all sunshine and rainbows - in comparison to our own dull lives - when viewed from the lens of social media. \n\nThe fact is that, life for everyone isn't actually as interesting as we think it is, but yet our warped view of it becomes an unattainable benchmark that some would fall into the trap of setting for themselves. We come to be deceived into believing that if our lives aren't all hunky-dory, then we are failing at life. \n\nIntrinsically, it may make us less content with our own lives, less grateful for what we have, bitter even. Extrinsically, we may end up doing a lot of unnecessary things to delude others (and ourselves) that our lives are just as great, overcompensating by doing things that we aren't actually intrinsically happy doing, but just for the sake of embellishing our lives for the Gram.

Well I better look damn good for it then. *When in reality, most people don't care much about how you live your life - they're too busy with theirs!*\n\nI'm rambling, but I guess I feel so strongly about this because it's something that I've only recently woken up to, and I've been a lot happier since.

        "content": "Psychologist here.\n\nOk, so in your body there are two systems that work against one another: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system amps you up. It increases your heart rate, shuts down your digestion and decreases blood-flow to non-important areas of your brain. In extreme cases, this can lead to shock, by the way.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system does the opposite. It kicks in if there is no stressor around and relaxes you. The idea here is that your body can't run at full throttle all the time, otherwise you'd have a lot of wear and tear.\n\nNow, how does this system kick in? There's a cool model, called the \"transactional stress model\". It basically says that the stress response is determined by two factors: how dangerous you perceive a situation, and how many resources you perceive to have to deal with it. If a situation is not dangerous and you have a lot of resources, it wont be as stressful. The parasympathetic nervous system will kick in and your \"stress level\" decreases. (I'm simplyfiying A LOT here).\n\nTo help yourself relax you can...\n\nA: Deal with stressors (finish tasks that stress you out)\n\nB: Change your perception of the stressors (Is it really that dangerous? Is it really important?)\n\nC: Change your perception of your available resources (for example: realize what people could help you, realize just how much time you have to deal with the issues at hand, etc.)\n\nOne thing proven to help with stress management is mindfulness meditation (for extreme cases see the mindfulness based stress reduction program). Mindfulness meditation can actually alter your brain structure to strengthen the parts that are important for emotion-control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to sum it up: your mind evaluates a situation and your body reacts to it. What you feel as stress (heart pumping, headaches, restlessness) is the reaction. By changing your perception, you change the reaction.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nEdit: wow, this really blew up! Thanks for all the feedback and the awards. I should clarify a few things though. First: I'm not a therapist. I specialized in work-psychology. Second: I don't do remote diagnosis. If you have specific issues, talk to a professional in person.\n\nEdit 2: I have a youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKbX8ZK5CKQBQSBAhtX__8Q where I'll have a video on stress management in Darkest Dungeon, soon. So if that sounds interesting, subscribe 😉"

Truth is, which is actual fact, Wordpress is the best open-sourced content management system that is extendible, only limited by your imagination.\n\nWordpress is easy to use, both for clients and for developers. The idea that Wordpress is bloated is just dumb, it only ever outputs what you want it to output. If you’re a half-assed ‘developer’ and use pre-built themes to create websites for your clients, you deserve a slow, shitty website. If you’re a developer that is worth anyone’s money, you’d be making themes from scratch and only using plugins where absolutely necessary. You control the output, if it’s bloated, that shits on you, not the CMS.\n\nAs a rule of thumb I only ever use three plugins; Advanced Custom Fields, Yoast SEO and a form builder.\n\nTldr; the idea that Wordpress is bloated is fucking bullshit unless you’re comparing it to a barebones static site. Wordpress is good in the right hands and is the best solution for most clients.\n\nEdit: I just looked at your post history and see you use themes when creating your sites. That there is your problem. Of course it’s gonna have bloat, these themes cater for everything and everyone all in one package the majority of the time."

        "title": "Google Alternatives huge list restore your privacy",
        "content": "*This guide aims to be the most exhaustive resource available for documenting alternatives to Google products.*\n\nWith growing concerns over online privacy and securing personal data, more people than ever are considering alternatives to Google products.\n\nAfter all, Google’s business model essentially revolves around data collection and advertisements, both of which infringe on your privacy. More data means better (targeted) ads and more revenue. The company pulled in over [$116 billion in ad revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/) last year alone – and that number continues to grow.\n\nBut the word is getting out. A growing number of people are seeking alternatives to Google products that respect their privacy and data.\n\nSo let’s get started.\n\n*Note: The lists below are not necessarily in rank order. Choose the best products and services based on your own unique needs.*\n\n## Google search alternatives\n\nWhen it comes to privacy, using Google search is not a good idea. When you use their search engine, Google is recording your IP address, search terms, user agent, and often a unique identifier, which is stored in cookies.\n\nHere are ten alternatives to Google search:\n\n1. [Searx](https://searx.me/) – A privacy-friendly and versatile metasearch engine that’s also [open source](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx).\n2. [MetaGer](https://metager.org/) – An open source metasearch engine with good features, based in Germany.\n3. [SwissCows](https://swisscows.com/) – A zero-tracking private search engine based in Switzerland, hosted on [secure Swiss infrastructure](https://swisscows.com/en/datacenter).\n4. [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/) – A private search engine based in France.\n5. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) – A private search engine based in the US.\n6. [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com/) – The only true search engine (rather than metasearch engine) that has its own crawler and index (based in the UK).\n7. [YaCy](https://yacy.net/en/index.html) – A decentralized, open source, peer-to-peer search engine.\n8. [Givero](https://www.givero.com/) – Based in Denmark, Givero offers more privacy than Google and combines search with charitable donations.\n9. [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) – Ecosia is based in Germany and donates a part of revenues to planting trees.\n\n\\*Note: With the exception of Mojeek, all of the private search engines above are technically metasearch engines, since they source their results from other search engines, such as Bing and Google.\n\n ([Startpage](https://restoreprivacy.com/startpage-system1-privacy-one-group) is no longer recommended.)\n\n## Gmail alternatives\n\nGmail may be convenient and popular, but there are three major problems:\n\n1. Your inbox is used as a data collection tool. (Did you know Google is [tracking your purchasing history](https://www.techspot.com/news/80134-google-uses-receipts-sent-gmail-log-online-purchases.html) from the receipts in your inbox?)\n2. Rather than seeing just emails, your email inbox is also used for ads and marketing.\n3. The contents of your inbox are being shared with Google and [other random third parties](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-dirty-secret-the-app-developers-sifting-through-your-gmail-1530544442).\n\nWhen you remain logged in to your Gmail account, Google can easily track your activities online as you browse different websites, which may be hosting Google Analytics or Google ads (Adsense).\n\nHere are ten alternatives to Gmail that do well in terms of privacy:\n\n1. [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) – based in Germany; very secure and private; free accounts up to 1 GB\n2. [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com/) – based in Belgium; lots of features; free accounts up to 500 MB\n3. [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en) – based in Germany; €1/mo with 14 day refund window\n4. [StartMail](https://www.startmail.com/en/) – based in Netherlands; $5.00/mo with 7 day free trial\n5. [Runbox](https://runbox.com/) – based in Norway; lots of storage and features; $1.66/mo with 30 day free trial\n6. [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/) – based in Germany; €1/mo with 30 day free trial\n7. [CounterMail](https://countermail.com/) – based in Sweden; $4.00/mo with 7 day free trial\n8. [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com/) – based in Switzerland; €4.41/mo with 30 day money-back guarantee\n9. [ProtonMail](https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail/) – based in Switzerland; free accounts up to 500 MB\n10. [Thexyz](https://www.thexyz.com/) – based in Canada; $1.95/mo with 30 day refund window\n\n## Chrome alternatives\n\nGoogle Chrome is a popular browser, but it’s also a data collection tool – and many people are taking notice. Just a few days ago, the [Washington Post asserted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/) that “**Google’s web browser has become spy software**,” with 11,000 tracker cookies observed in a single week.\n\nHere are seven alternatives for more privacy:\n\n1. [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/) – Firefox is a very customizable, open-source browser that is popular in privacy circles. There are also many different [Firefox modifications and tweaks](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/) that will give you more privacy and security. (Also check out Firefox Focus, a privacy-focused version for mobile users.)\n2. [Iridium](https://iridiumbrowser.de/) – Based on open source Chromium, Iridium offers numerous [privacy and security enhancements](https://github.com/iridium-browser/tracker/wiki/Differences-between-Iridium-and-Chromium) over Chrome, source code [here](https://github.com/iridium-browser).\n3. [GNU IceCat](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/) – A fork of Firefox from the Free Software Foundation.\n4. [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) – A hardened and secured version of Firefox that runs on the [Tor network](https://restoreprivacy.com/tor/) by default. (It also does a good job against [browser fingerprinting](https://restoreprivacy.com/browser-fingerprinting/).)\n5. [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) – Just as the name says, this is an open source version of Chromium that has been “ungoogled” and modified for more privacy.\n6. [Brave](https://brave.com/) – Brave is another Chromium-based browser that is rather popular. It blocks trackers and ads by default (except for “approved” ads that are part of the “Brave Ads” network).\n7. [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) – This is a fork of Firefox that is configured for more privacy by default, with Mozilla telemetry stripped out of the code.\n\nOf course, there are other alternatives to Chrome, such as Safari (from Apple), Microsoft Internet Explorer/Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi – but these also come with some privacy drawbacks.\n\n## Google Drive alternatives\n\nIf you’re looking for a secure cloud storage option, you can check out these Google Drive alternatives:\n\n1. [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/) – A user-friendly cloud storage option based in Switzerland.\n2. [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) – An open source and self-hosted cloud platform developed in Germany.\n3. [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) – Nextcloud is also an open source, self-hosted file sharing and collaboration platform, based in Germany.\n4. [Sync](https://www.sync.com/) – Based in Canada, Sync offers a secure, encrypted cloud storage solution for businesses and individuals.\n5. [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/master) – Here we have a decentralized, open source, peer-to-peer cloud storage platform.\n\nOf course, Dropbox is another popular Google drive alternative, but it’s not the best in terms of privacy.\n\n## Google Calendar alternative\n\nHere are some Google Calendar alternatives:\n\n1. [Lightning Calendar](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/calendar/) is an open source calendar option developed by Mozilla, and it’s compatible with Thunderbird and Seamonkey.\n2. [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar), an open source, basic calendar option.\n3. [Fruux](https://fruux.com/), an open source calendar with good features and support for many operating systems.\n\nFor those wanting a combined solution for both email and calendar functionality, these providers offer that:\n\n* [Mailfence](https://blog.mailfence.com/secure-online-mailfence-calendar/)\n* [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com/feature/calendar)\n* [Posteo.de](https://posteo.de/en)\n* [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/)\n* [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/free-encrypted-calendar/)\n\n## Google Docs / Sheets / Slides alternative\n\nThere are many solid Google Docs alternatives available. The largest offline document editing suite is, of course, Microsoft Office. As most people know, however, Microsoft is not the best company for privacy. Nonetheless, there are a few other good Google Docs alternatives:\n\n1. [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/) – CryptPad is a privacy-focused alternative with strong encryption, and it’s free.\n2. [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) – A self-hosted collaborative online editor that’s also open source.\n3. [Mailfence Documents](https://blog.mailfence.com/secure-file-sharing/) – From the Mailfence team, this is a secure file sharing, storage, and collaboration tool.\n4. [Zoho Docs](https://www.zoho.com/docs/) – This is another good Google Docs alternative with a clean interface and good functionality, although it may not be the best for privacy.\n5. [OnlyOffice](https://personal.onlyoffice.com/) – OnlyOffice feels a bit more restricted than some of the other options in terms of features.\n6. [Cryptee](https://crypt.ee/) – This is a privacy-focused platform for photo and document storage and editing. It’s open source and based in Estonia.\n7. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (offline) – You can use LibreOffice which is free and open source.\n8. [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) (offline) – Another good open source office suite.\n\n## Google Photos alternative\n\nHere are a few good Google Photos alternatives:\n\n* [Piwigo](https://piwigo.org/) – Piwigo is a great option that you can self-host. It is also free and open source.\n* [Lychee](https://lychee.electerious.com/) – Lychee is another self-hosted, open source photo management platform.\n* [Cryptee](https://crypt.ee/) – Mentioned already above, Cyrptee is also a great option for securely storing photos.\n\nShoebox was another alternative, but it [closed operations](https://shoeboxapp.com/) in June 2019.\n\n## YouTube alternatives\n\nUnfortunately, YouTube alternatives can really be hit or miss, with most struggling to gain popularity.\n\n1. [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/en/)\n2. [DTube](https://d.tube/)\n3. [Bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/)\n4. [invidio.us](https://invidio.us/)\n5. [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)\n6. [Bit.tube](https://bit.tube/)\n7. [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/)\n8. [Hooktube](https://hooktube.com/)\n\n**Tip**: Invidio.us is a great Youtube proxy that allows you to watch any Youtube video without logging in, even if the video is somehow restricted. To do this, simply replace \\[[www.youtube.com\\]](http://www.youtube.com]) with \\[invidio.us\\] in the URL you want to view.\n\n## Google translate alternative\n\nHere are a few Google translate alternatives I have come across:\n\n1. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) – DeepL is a solid Google Translate alternative that seems to give great results. Like Google Translate, DeepL allows you to post up to 5,000 characters at a time (but the pro version is unlimited). The user interface is good and there is also a built-in dictionary feature.\n2. [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/) – Linguee does not allow you to post large blocks of text like DeepL. However, Linguee will give you very accurate translations for single words or phrases, along with context examples.\n3. [dict.cc](https://www.dict.cc/) – This Google Translate alternative seems to do a decent job on single-world lookups, but it also feels a bit outdated.\n4. [Swisscows Translate](https://swisscows.ch/translate) – A good translation service supporting many languages.\n\nIf you want to translate blocks of text, check out [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator). If you want in-depth translations for single words or phrases, then [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/) is a good choice.\n\n## Google analytics alternative\n\nFor website admins, there are many reasons to use an alternative to Google analytics. Aside from privacy concerns, there are also faster and more user-friendly alternatives that also respect your visitors’ privacy.\n\n1. [Clicky](https://clicky.com/) is a great alternative to Google Analytics that truncates and anonymizes visitor IP addresses by default. It is lightweight, user-friendly, and fully compliant with GDPR regulations, while also being certified by [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).\n2. [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly Piwik) is an open-source analytics platform that respects the privacy of visitors by anonymizing and truncating visitor IP addresses (if enabled by the website admin). It is also [certified](https://matomo.org/privacy/) to respect user privacy.\n3. [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) is an open source alternative to Google Analytics that’s available [on Github here](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom). It’s minimal, fast, and lightweight.\n4. [Get Insights](https://getinsights.io/) – Another privacy-focused analytics platform, with a full analytics suite. The front-end client is open source and available [here](https://github.com/getinsights/insights-js).\n5. [AT Internet](https://www.atinternet.com/en/) is a France-based analytics provider that is fully [GDPR compliant](https://www.atinternet.com/en/company/data-protection/), with all data stored on French servers, and a good track record going back to 1996.\n\nMany websites host Google Analytics because they run Google Adsense campaigns. Without Google Analytics, tracking performance of these campaigns would be difficult. Nonetheless, there are still better options for privacy.\n\n## Google Maps alternative\n\nA map alternative for PCs is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).\n\nA few Google Maps alternatives for mobile devices include:\n\n1. [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) is a free and open-source mobile maps app for both Android and iOS (based on OpenStreetMap data).\n2. [Maps (F Droid)](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.maps/) uses OpenStreetMap data (offline).\n3. [Maps.Me](http://maps.me/en/home) is another option that is free on both Android and iOS, but there is a fair amount of data collection with this alternative, as explained in their [privacy policy](https://legal.my.com/us/maps/privacy/).\n4. [MapHub](https://maphub.net/) is also based on OpenStreeMap data and it does not collect locations or user IP addresses.\n\nNote: Waze is not an “alternative” as it is now owned by Google.\n\n## Google Play Store alternative\n\nCurrently the best Google Play Store alternative is to use **F-Droid** and then go through the **Yalp store**. As explained on the [official site](https://f-droid.org/en/), F-Droid is an installable catalog of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform.\n\nAfter you have installed F-Droid, you can then download the Yalp store APK, which allows you to download apps from the Google Play Store directly as APK files.\n\n📷The Yalp Store is a good alternative to the Google Play Store.\n\nSee the [F-Droid website](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/) or the official [GitHub page](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) for more info. Other alternatives to the Google Play Store include:\n\n* [Aptoide](https://www.aptoide.com/) – An independent marketplace for Android apps.\n* [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) – This is a large library of APK files uploaded by different users (be careful).\n* [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore) – A fork of the Yalp Store.\n\n## Google Chrome OS alternative\n\nWant to ditch the Chromebook and Chrome OS? Here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) – Of course, Linux is arguably the best alternative, being a free, open-source operating system with lots of different flavors. With some adjustments, [Linux Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) can be run on Chromebooks.\n2. [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) – Tails is a free, privacy-focused operating system based on Linux that routes all traffic through the Tor network.\n3. [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) – Recommended by Snowden, free, and also open source.\n\nOf course, the other two big operating system alternatives are Windows and Apple’s operating system for MacBooks – Mac OS. Windows, particularly Windows 10, is a very bad option for privacy. While slightly better, Apple also collects user data and has [partnered with the NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)) for surveillance.\n\n## Android alternatives\n\nThe biggest alternative to Android is iOS from Apple. But we’ll skip over that for reasons already mentioned. Here are a few Android OS alternatives:\n\n1. [LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) – A free and open-source operating system for phones and tablets based on Android.\n2. [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) – A mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system.\n3. [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/) – An open source, Linux-based operating system with active development.\n4. [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) – Another open source, Linux-based mobile OS.\n5. [Replicant](https://replicant.us/) – A fully free Android distribution with an emphasis on freedom, privacy, and security.\n6. [/e/](https://e.foundation/) – This is another open source project with a focus on privacy and security.\n\nPurism is also working on a privacy-focused mobile phone called the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/). It is in production, but not yet available (estimated Q3 2019).\n\n## Google Hangouts alternatives\n\nHere are some alternatives to Google Hangouts:\n\n1. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) – A great all-around secure messenger, video, and chat app, but somewhat limited on the number of people who can chat together in a group conversation via voice or video.\n2. [Signal](https://signal.org/) – A good secure messenger platform from Open Whisper Systems.\n3. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) – A longtime secure messenger app, formerly based in Russia, now in Dubai.\n4. [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) – A privacy-focused encrypted chat service that is also open source.\n\n## Google Domains alternative\n\nGoogle Domains is a domain registration service. Here are a few alternatives:\n\n1. [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) – I like Namecheap because all domain purchases now come with **free WhoisGuard protection for life**, which protects your contact information from third parties. Namecheap also accepts Bitcoin and offers domain registration, hosting, email, SSL certs, and a variety of other products.\n2. [Njalla](https://njal.la/) – Njalla is a privacy-focused domain registration service based in Nevis. They offer hosting options, too, and also accept cryptocurrency payments.\n3. [OrangeWebsite](https://www.orangewebsite.com/) – OrangeWebsite offers anonymous domain registration services and also accepts cryptocurrency payments, based in Iceland.\n\n## Other Google alternatives\n\nHere more alternatives for various Google products:\n\n**Google forms alternative** – [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/) is a free online form builder.\n\n**Google Keep alternative** – Below are a few different Google Keep alternatives:\n\n* [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) is a great alternative for a note-taking service. It is secure, encrypted, and free with apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android (web-based also available).\n* [Joplin](https://joplin.cozic.net/) is another great option that is open source and works on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n* [Zoho Notebook](https://www.zoho.com/notebook/?src=restore_privacy) from Zoho, with apps for desktop and mobile devices.\n* [QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org/) is an open source file editor with Nextcloud integration.\n\n**Google Fonts alternative** – Many websites load Google fonts through Google APIs, but that’s not necessary. One alternative to this is to use [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/), which has a large selection of both Google and non-Google fonts which are free to download and use.\n\n**Google Voice alternative** – [JMP.chat](https://jmp.chat/) (both free and paid)\n\n**G Suite alternative** – [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) is probably the best option\n\n**Google Firebase alternative** – [Kuzzle](https://kuzzle.io/) (free and open source)\n\n**Google Blogger alternatives** – [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) are all good options."

Is what we're trying to do necessary? Is this a real problem we're trying to solve, and are we the ones that should be solving it?\" And of course, the most pertinent tech company question, \"Is this really a tech company or does it just have the veneer of one so it can use large venture capital funds to skirt regulations around existing industries and create proto-monopolies that it will then exploit in the future?\""

        "content": "Every other language feels like it was written according to the computer's requirements. It's the computer that needs excessive brackets and semicolons and type declarations, even when the type is obvious. \n\nPython feels like it was written for humans first. The syntax feels far less superfluous, and the interpreter figures things out for you. \n\nGranted, this isn't 100% good. There just isn't another language -that I'm aware of- that has a \"Pythonic\" equivalent. The decidedly idiomatic style takes some adjustment.  \n\nFor this reason, I don't think it makes a great first language, but it makes for the most productive language, once you learn its flow. \n\nAlso, a business centric community, PEP8, its inclusion in every Linux box, and virtual environments.\n\nThough, I really wish package management would get thoroughly straightened out, once and for all."

        "content": "Pornography is a fantasy-based form of entertainment, and if it's viewed as such, is fairly innocuous. \n\nOne big problem is that pornography is often viewed as *educational*, either in a narrow sense (\"this is how people like to have sex\" or \"these acts and behaviors are part of good sex\") or as contributing to a broader view. (\"this is a normal way to view sexuality\") No one, anywhere, watches \"The Fast and The Furious\" thinking it's a good way to learn how to drive, or that they, the viewer, are going to regularly be driving cars like they see in the screen. Everyone knows that the actors who star in Marvel superhero movies have access to world-class trainers and nutritionists, plus great stunt doubles, and lots of training and practice for stunt work that's choreographed in advance. But somehow, people watch porn and *don't* realize that slapping/spitting/choking/etc are all things negotiated beforehand, off-camera, that the bodies they're seeing *aren't* typical people, and that lots of what they're seeing is being done not because it's fun or enjoyable, but to accommodate a camera angle. \n\nAnother big problem with pornography (though it's not exclusive to pornography) is that it provides fantasy-based wish-fulfillment. Like every other form of escapism, (watching movies, reading books, playing video games) it can be a pleasant diversion from the frustrations of daily life and provide a vicarious sense of achievement or success when we're lacking those things otherwise. This isn't an inherently *bad* thing if enjoyed in moderation, and not to the neglect or exclusion of actual efforts towards success or achievement in our daily lives. But some people will struggle with that moderation, and some people will choose escapism over effort. \n\nOne aspect of pornography that *does* separate it from other forms of escapism is the ease-of-access, non-existent cost, and massive variety available on the internet. Video games cost money, take time to download and install, and require a certain time commitment for playing. Similar barriers exist for books and movies and other hobbies, which makes abusing them more difficult. Gambling has a monetary cost that often slows or impedes abuse for many. But with pornography and the internet, the *only* barriers really are a person's ability to delay gratification and voluntarily limit their consumption, and for people who haven't developed those skills, obviously there's a risk of abuse."

Finding all of that probably made you lose your breath, made your heart go up into your throat, and like you said, made you feel numb. \n\nIt’s time to let reason and logic take over while emotions go to the back burner. I know that sounds harsh, but you don’t need emotions clouding your judgment right now. Your emotions are completely valid, but you need to do what is necessary to take care of you. Right now.\n\nYou know, deep down, that this is not sustainable. What you need to decide is whether you want to forgive this, or get away. That choice is 100% up to you, and you only.\n\nThe fact that you have proof before you confront her is your only ace. Play it well. Because there are two options; however, both require that you have ALL evidence upfront. Keep everything. \n\nIf you want to stay, she better damn well apologize and mean it. That means cutting off all contact, rebuilding trust with you, and checking in with your relationship. And that’s AFTER agreeing to counseling and fixing things, while taking accountability.\n\nIf you want to leave - dude, you’re more than justified. You know your relationship best; is this just a side effect of the actual problem? Is this a one-off or have you felt this for awhile? Sometimes cheating is a symptom of the problem, the problem can be much bigger. If this is the icing on the cake, you don’t need Reddit’s permission to leave.\n\nDo what’s right for you. And if you don’t have kids, my personal (unsolicited) advice is to leave now. \n\nThis kind of hung-up-on-her ex shit usually doesn’t get better. \n\nBest of luck to you, I wish you the best. You deserve to be happy."

        "content": "My advice as a 38 year old man from NZ? Try to stop worrying about achieving something by x date and start simply trying to find your version of happiness. \n\nI’m not going full blown hippie on ya. I believe we are conditioned to constantly feel like we should be productive, constantly compare ourselves to others and that “success” is things/money based. Throw that mindset away - it’s nonsense!\n\nThe search for your individual happiness means there is no else you can compare to. Your happiness is yours alone.\n\nIt can be as small as 30 mins of exercise or a favourite snack. Can be as large as starting a savings account slowly ticking over or being brave and vulnerable in a relationship. Daily, weekly, monthly - you can take small, medium and large action.\n\nYour happiness can change and evolve. Evolve with it.\n\nDon’t see your job or salary as something that defines your worth. See them as a means to helping you achieve happiness in certain aspects of your life. If your job hurts then start thinking about doing something else.\n\nWe spend our lives in mental prisons thinking we aren’t good enough and that time is running out. We are! You are! You have the most time available to you now. Spend it on you - Fuck the noise and find your happiness.\n\nIt may sound easier said than done but nothing worth while is easy. Some of your happiness will require work, sacrifice and reflection. Start small and go from there. You got this!\n\nThe secret of life in my opinion is not accruing a list of achievements but living your life as much as possible on your own terms and being kind to others.\n\nUpdate: My second award ever! Thank you very much!\n\nUpdate 2: I’m truly overwhelmed and humbled by the response my words have had. I just want to say thank you for all the insight and chats started. All the honesty and desire to make ourselves happier, content and the sharing of mistakes along the way.\n\nAll the awards are astounding - thank you. I’m just glad my words resonated!\n\nThank you and best of luck for your search for what makes you happy. I hope you all find it. I hope you all live peaceful lives. You deserve nothing less"

If the language doesn't enforce your types, then you must do it as a discipline.\n\nSecond, if you haven't already, **use the debugger** to follow the flow of data as it trickles through your application. Check that everything is as you expect it to be.\n\nThird, **triple-check your assumptions by identifying them, then proving them true.** If you cannot find the problem where you thought to look, then enumerate the assumptions you did not think to check. Start with any intuitions you may have by this point, and then continue from the simplest and quickest to prove on up to the more complicated and time-consuming to prove.\n\nFourth, sometimes you need to **write unit tests** as a debugging step.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I assumed that at least some decent level of testing existed already.\n\nSome assumptions which aren't testable or worth testing:\n\n- I *have* saved my file.\n- My server *doesn't* need restarted.\n- `new Date()` will return an instance of the Date **built-in**.

        "content": "I don't think it's really about the commissions. They matter, but the timing of this suggests there's an ulterior motive, especially if you dig deeper into their actual lawsuit filing. If you read the text, section I.D.90 Epic Games notes:\n\n>Absent Apple's Anti-Competitive conduct, Epic Games would also create an app store for iOS.\n\nhttps://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf\n\nWhy does this matter? \n\n**It’s China fighting for control**\n\nEpic is owned in partnership by Tencent, one of the biggest Chinese tech companies that owns [48.5%](https://www.pcgamer.com/chinese-internet-company-tencent-owns-40-percent-of-epic-games/) stake in the Epic. Not only is that basically a partnership, it has also made Epic a LOT of money. \n\nNow, it MIGHT be a coincidence that Epic/Tencent is suddenly deciding to choose now to launch two separate lawsuits against Apple AND Google, all over a game that they've had no issues with other platforms on, especially with the anti-trust investigation going on. After all, it isn’t out of the ordinary for Epic to want to not pay commission, they’ve been saying so for ages, but the LAWSUIT makes no sense. Even if Epic wins and they can release Fortnite on a sideload, it really isn't worth a lawsuit for them just to get to sideload Fortnite onto iOS. \n\nHere’s the kicker: A lot of people don’t know this but Epic actually ALREADY had a side loaded App Store on android, the EXACT thing they’re suing Apple to do now.  [They tried it already on Android and it did terribly, and then they just went back to Google Play,](https://www.reviewgeek.com/40729/epic-fails-finally-puts-fortnite-on-the-play-store-for-android-players/) so they know that the additional revenue won't matter much. \n\nAs a matter of fact, look at the date. Epic had JUST put Fortnite onto the play store in **APRIL** of this year. Why deliberately get pulled only 4 months later, just to start a lawsuit to have the right to... do exactly what you just failed? Why fight to start a battle you ALREADY KNOW won’t generate income?\n\nWhat’s more interesting is the actual legal team Epic put together. They hired  none other than [Christine Varney, who served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division under President Barack Obama.](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/13/spotify-supports-epic-games-private-antitrust-action-against-apple) to lead the legal team. These are big guns they’re playing with. They’re looking to set a legal precedent at a high level. \n\nNot just weird timing, they also baited both Google and Apple to pull their apps and then IMMEDIATELY filed the suit with a [FULLY-PRODUCED AD](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/8/13/21367904/epic-parody-apple-1984-ad-fortnite-removal-app-store) ready to go.  They’re prepared for the PR angle, and they got Spotify (which Tencent is also the largest external investor on at 9.5%) to immediately jump on the news in support. There's real money here and they're coming guns blazing for a fight, and are clearly prepared. All this just for a video game that’s ALREADY incredibly profitable?\n\nWhat if it’s not about Fortnite, but about Tencent’s MUCH MUCH bigger product, WeChat? Or ALL of Tencent’s services? for context, Tencent is comparable to the Facebook of China, (Tencent’s valuation is $660 billion, while Facebook is $700 billion). \n\nIf you've been living under a rock, in the past few weeks, the [US and other nations (including India) have been threatening to ban WeChat, ](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/)which would be a pretty significant blow to China as anyone with an iPhone in China would be severely gimped. If wechat is actually banned from the iPhone, other Chinese brands are at risk, and therefore, all the Data that goes with it. \n\nWeChat isn't just a social media app, it also handles things like payment systems, taxi ordering, elearning, and gaming. Entire Apps are built on WeChat. For many in China, WeChat *is* the internet. \n\nLiterally, JUST NOW, Trump JUST ordered Bytedance to sell off the US part of Tiktok in the next 90 days. If they order that for Wechat, not only is Tencent in trouble, ALL Chinese services are on alert. Now, that would be worth a fight. \n\nSo why does this lawsuit matter?\n**I think this is about them getting to cut out Apple to get their own App marketplaces on iPhones, thereby gaining control**. \n\nIf they succeed, Trump can threaten to shut down WeChat or any Chinese app all they want, but it wouldn't affect iPhone users in China. Not only that, it lets China open a massive floodgate of ALL of their developers and services into the world. They could take on a lot more than just China. \n\nChina has had some hardware success with Huawei, Xiaomi, and Lenovo, but their  services (where the data collection lives) are limited in the West. And with the Tiktok ban, all the other countries are cutting them down even more. If they can get their own App Store up, undercut the App Store, they could have a real shot at swaying users over. And there’s nothing that Apple or even the US can really do about it— they’d have to create a ban for all Chinese apps on the ISP level, which would be a regulatory nightmare. \n\nIf they win this fight, they get control of iPhones. No pesky App Store policies on privacy, security, or IP. They can undercut Apple by taking a 5% revenue and developers would flood over. They could replicate any app and not care about IP. You have a new game? Cool, it’s mine now, and I’m going to outspend you 100X in marketing. What are you going to do, SUE them in Chinese courts?\n\nBut more importantly... *Think about the data they can collect*.\n\n**TL;DR:** Don't be fooled. This is NOT about Fortnite. This is about the US/China tradewar."

        "content": "Hi! 20 year MMO server-side engineering veteran here, so I'm delighted by this question. The best way to answer it is with a very specific example, to get you a general idea.\n\nOne of the most important checks a server has to do is to verify whether players are colliding with each other, or the environment, or are aimed right for weapons fire, etc. Because these checks are computationally expensive, we resort to clever tricks to avoid having to do them for everything in the world every time.\n\nOne trick is to partition your world. Take your game map, and divide it into four quadrants. If two players are in the same quadrant, you know you have to look closer to see if they're colliding. But if one player is completely in quadrant 1, and another is completely in quadrant 4, you can skip that check because you know there's no way they can be physically touching.\n\nBut say two players are both in quadrant 1. Well, you can also subdivide quadrant 1 into four quadrants!  1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d.  Now similarly, if both players are in 1a, you need to look closer. But if one is in 1a and another in 1d, you can skip checking them. You keep doing this until the quadrants become so small that further partitioning isn't very useful.\n\nAnother benefit with this approach is parallel computation. For example, you can have one server thread or process running the check on everyone in quadrant 1, and a separate process running it on everyone in quadrant 4. They can do this independently because you know you don't ever have to compare anyone across these quadrants.\n\nTrouble is, if EVERY player is in tiniest quadrant 1a-iii., now you're back to having to directly compare every character to every other character in the most expensive way possible, and there's no super easy or cheap ways to parallelize that computation. And that's when your server hardware starts to choke.\n\nThis example is only about collision. But the point is, there are probably 9-10 different places in MMO server development where we *conceptually* take similar shortcuts -- even down to simple things like just how much data a server can physically upload to players over its network card at once -- which rely on the assumption that not everyone is in exactly the same place.\n\n(Edit: tweaked a few words for clarity, based on some of the excellent follow-up questions I got asked.)"

China doesn't like not knowing where you want to connect to!\n* All extensions have a \"reference number\". ESNI is **0xffce**. If China sees that in your communication it'll block the connection.\n* However, newer extensions aren't blocked (yet), example **0xff02 03 04**.

China seems to search for just 1 5-byte long packet. If you send it in say one 4-byte and one 1-byte packets, it won't catch that.\n\n**Strategy 3**: Trick the CN Firewall thinking the connection has been torn down (by injecting a broken RST packet)\n\n**Strategy 4**: Different way of Strategy 1, using a FIN+SYN packets to re-synchronise into a different connection than the original one\n\n**Strategy 5**: Confuse the firewall by sending SYN+ACK packets, so it doesn't know if it's the server or the client.\n\n**Strategy 6**: Add extra payload (random data) to the packet, breaking its checksum\n\nEdit: If one has an interest and likes to experiment or play around, a good  start in manipulating, constructing and injecting packets is with [Scapy](https://scapy.net/).\n\nI'm surprised China hasn't protected itself against some of these.. but IMO it's just a matter of time before they do.\n\nEdit 2: thank you so much for my first 2 awards!

        "content": "I feel like the author starts out with some misconceptions about these principles, and then he follows the logic through to absurd or contradictory conclusions. When you reach a contradiction or a failure of logic, it seems like you should go back and double-check your assumptions before declaring the whole thing broken. Do we assume that many smart, experienced programmers are all wrong about these principles, or that one blog writer has some misunderstandings?\n\nSRP is not about having \"one reason to change\". Changing code is the responsibility of the programmer. The responsibility of the class is to *do something*, either in terms of control flow, orchestration, data flow, delegation, business logic or something like that. A class should *do one thing*. If you defined SRP in terms of there being one reason to change a class you run into immediate conflicts with OCP, which should have set off a red flag.\n\nObviously when you're talking about a deployed library, the team who didn't write the library can't modify the classes. Even talking about this fact makes me wonder if the author really understands OCP, and then he uses an example with a Decorator pattern, instead of Dependency Injection which is the far more common implementation. OCP is about separating logic which does not need to change frequently, from logic which does need to change frequently, and making it so the common changes are easy to make without side-effects or test regressions.\n\nFor LSP he makes this quote:\n\n>“an object can be replaced by any instance of its subtype without altering the correctness of the program”\n\nThat's not quite the perfect definition, and obviously replacing a value calculator class by a subtype which divides all answers in half is going to break the correctness of your business logic. LSP is about *respecting the intent of the interface*. If I have a calculator interface \\`ICalculator\\` which exposes a method \\`int Calculate()\\`, I shouldn't reuse that same interface for a case where I need to interact with an external database and return an integer error code, even though the method signature \\`int (\\*)()\\` is the same for both. This is where the author should have shown an example using the Decorator pattern. (He also gets into a weird place where he talks about leaky abstractions and \\`IQueryable\\` from C#, which really isn't related to LSP). At least he ends with this quote, which is the least wrong thing he says in this section:\n\n>the user of the interface should ignore the implementation details and should use the interface the same way for every implementations.\n\nFor ISP he again seems to misunderstand. It's not about having \"lots\" of interfaces, it's about not burdening people with details they don't require. Wikipedia says it best:\n\n> the **interface-segregation principle** (**ISP**) states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.\n\nAnd finally with DIP the author clearly is having some kind of a lapse here, either he doesn't know what *coupling* is or he doesn't understand dependencies (he doesn't know the difference between a direct and an indirect dependency, etc). And through all this he doesn't say anything about *inversion*, which is what the principle is supposed to be about. Almost every single discussion about DIP should involve the \\`new\\` keyword, but the author doesn't acknowledge this at all.\n\nUnfortunately this blog post is very misleading and incorrect in several places. There are better places to learn about SOLID, and if you want to become a better programmer (and *everybody can be better*) trying to learn SOLID more deeply is an important step on the journey."

Write it! Crazy I know. Instead, make some kind of dev blog and post your tutorial in written form. This way people can read it at their own pace, I can skim over the parts or someone who wants to know every detail can read everything as they wish, and you know what's the best part? I can copy you code instantly without having to go through your source code link in description and you don't have set up an additional repository (or worse, some pastebin~like nonsense). Then there is the fact that editing videos to fix mistakes or making it up-to-date with new information being so much harder than simply editing text for the same purpose. You see, since modifying text is much easier, it also shapes up in a more organic and natural way in an iterative process compared to a video where you have to record it in full chunks if you don't want to heavily edit the result.\n\nI really wish barrier to entry wasn't so low for some things but oh well."

        "content": "I've worked as a data engineer in 3 companies in Europe and currently switching to backend(working for 2 teams, 50/50 split,  at the moment). I imagine it's similar to how stuff works in America as well(statistically, you are from the US). What I wrote here comes only from my direct experience and my coworkers experience. YMMV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some definitions**\n\nWhat is called \"Data Engineer\" almost always means SQL + Redshift/BigQuery/etc + Python(for Airflow, PySpark and stuff like that). You will be building pipelines, meaning - chains of scripts, where they depend on each other. You don't have to think of it as anything more complex than this.\n\nWhat is called \"Software Engineer - Big Data\" or \"Data Infrastracture Engineer\" tends to mean working with a JVM language like Scala or Java or sometimes Python again to build the \"core pipeline\". Basically you collect data from all sorts of sources and write it to Kafka or some other type of storage, and/or sometimes make it available through an API of some sort. You usually just validate it against some sort of schema, and that's it. Sometimes you build a Data Warehouse(basically, an SQL layer that analysts and scientists will work with) on top of that. But I've noticed that companies tend to delegate the task of building the Data Warehouse on \"Data Engineers\" instead of \"Software Engineer - Big Data\" people.\n\nThis is the core distinction: DEs build the data warehouse; \"SE - big data\" build server-side software that makes raw, possibly streaming data accessible to the scripts that load ths data into the data warehouse and to other software. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo from my experience, the line has become quite clear. Personally, I would prefer to be on the \"software engineering\" side of things as much as possible, which is why I'm switching to backend development internally in my current company. By the way, I was able to do this only thanks to the personal trust of the CTO and some other core figures. My attempts at external transfers were a disaster, because the market wanted me to know backend frameworks(Spring, Django etc) well. They gave no shits about my \"problem solving\" capabilities or whatever. That's just how it is in my local market.\n\n**Transitioning from one role to another**\n\nLast word about transferring: YES it's easier to go from backend to data eng than the other way around. I've seen people becoming data engineers with ALL sorts of different backgrounds. The myth that it's a senior-level role for very smart people just has to die as quickly as possible. Just like with data science, the role has been simplified, and the expectations for the candidates have lowered. While my AND my colleagues' attempt to switch to backend engineering have been a disaster. Again, I could only switch because of the trust I get in my current company.\n\n**Salary**\n\nThe salaries in smaller companies are comparable to backend devs. I would say that they even sometimes exceed the backend salaries - but not by a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Core thing I want to emphasise!**\n\nData Engineers, in MY experience as a data engineer in 3 \"normal\", non-FAANG companies, DO NOT BUILD USER-FACING APPLICATIONS! They write a shit ton of SQL queries, scripts/jobs, and SOMETIMES(!!!) constantly running processes that listen to kafka! These are all useful skills, but if your experience is >50% just writing SQL and scripts you will NOT be easily able to transfer to backend development. You can call this shit 'data apps' as much as you want, the market KNOWS it's not applications. They are not that stupid."

There are frameworks you can use that allows you to query databases without writing SQL queries. \n\nFramework themselves are written in and help with a specific language.\n\nSo for example:\n\nJavascript is a language. You can use it directly if you want.\n\nAngular is a framework in Javascript. You can use Angular for your website to build more sophisticated user experiences quickly.\n\nWhy not use Javascript directly and skip Angular? You can, but you will find that for complex user experiences a framework enables you to do more.\n\nHope this helps."

The first half of the 20th century saw lots of focus on theory. This is obviously closely connected to philosophy but is grounded in math (not data). Think about the work of von Neumann on uncertainty in utility functions (1940s i think), Nash on game theory (1951), even stuff like Akerlofs Market for Lemons (1970) or Weitzmans Prices v Quantities (1977). None of these involved data but were constructed from mathematical primitives.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the econ profession underwent the \"credibility revolution\" with much more focus paid to econometrics and in particular the identification of causality in econometrics as well as more focus on the robustness of key model results to assumptions and modeling decisions. Angrist and Pischke have a nice piece in the Journal of Economic Perspectives that describe this.\n\nIts important to think about what theory or philosophy based econ can and can't tell us. We know that theory suggests that minimum wages will reduce labor demand and at first pass a philosopher economist might tell the president to get rid of the minimum wage. The theory driven result depends on various parameters such as the elasticity of demand for labor, market efficiency, etc. By using rigorous empirics we can estimate what the causal effect of minimum wage on employment and avoid the specific assumptions about elasticity of demand for labor and make informed decisions about the marginal effect of our policy lever (min wage) on the thing we care about (employment)."

        "title": "Exploit Development Learning Roadmap",
        "content": "Exploit Development is hard, learning how to do it is going to require a lot of study, practice and a good understanding of a fairly wide range of associated subjects. The good news is that you don't have to learn everything at once, or overnight, and that there are a lot of people who have done or are on the same painful journey - some of whom write blogs like [corelan security](https://www.corelan.be/) or [fuzzy security](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/).\n\nThe generally recommended approach for a beginner is to start at the beginning, the late 90's style simple stack based buffer overflows popularised by Aleph One's \"Smashing the stack for fun and profit\", and then to gradually work on introducing and defeating progressively more modern mitigations, new exploitation vectors and architectures. As you do this and practise against real world exploits you start to pick up some of the ancillary knowledge from your own research, and don't forget to make notes, you might find it helps to keep a blog, or post walkthroughs of your exploits here\n\n******************************************\n\n# 0: Base knowledge\n\n_Exactly what skill level you need to be at before starting to learn about binary exploitation is always going to be something that causes some people concerns. Are you ready yet? The answer is generally yes and no, you learn more by starting today and failing than any amount of procrastination, but at the same time every time you learn something new you discover two things that you don't understand. Hacking is terrible for this, the more I learn the more I feel like a complete newbie. The only thing for it is to try; the worst case is that you discover that you need to learn some other stuff first, and it never hurts to read a book._\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n_[A variety of books](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploitDev/comments/7ywp7a/exploit_development_books/)_\n\n_**Recommended Subjects:**_\n\n_An understanding of C / C++_\n\n_Memory and CPU concepts such as memory addressing, registers and stacks_\n\n_A scripting language such as Python, Perl, Ruby or Bash_\n\n_Fluency in your chosen OS, and at least a basic understanding of whichever debugger you're using_\n\n******************************************\n\n# 1: Smashing the Stack - 32 bit overflows with no mitigations\n\n_The question of platforms to use as your victims is mostly a personal choice, some people like to learn Windows exploitation first and then move to Linux, whereas some (like myself) prefer to start with Linux exploitation before moving to Windows. In my opinion there are more and better resources for learning the basics on Linux but the choice really is yours._\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n  _[Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploitDev/comments/7vuklu/smashing_the_stack_for_fun_and_profit_aleph_one/)_\n\n  _[Exploit Exercises Protostar: Stack levels 0-5](https://exploit.education/protostar/stack-zero/)_\n\n  _Some of the concepts involved in learning how to do this kind of simple exploitation will be quite alien to a novice, but with some time spent hands on with a debugger you should start to get an understanding of some of the things you're going to need to read up about_\n\n******************************************\n\n# 2: Format String Vulnerabilities\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n_[Introduction to Format String Exploits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploitDev/comments/7zdr4l/introduction_to_format_string_exploits/)_\n\n_[Exploit Exercises Protostar: Format levels 0-4](https://exploit.education/protostar/format-zero/)_\n\n_Format string exploits are a good next step after simple buffer overflows because they share a great many similarities, but also give you an opportunity to play around with arbitrary memory manipulations. Format strings also shows you some of the weirdness that can result in exploitable situations_\n\n******************************************\n\n# 3: Return to LibC - Defeating Non-Executable Stacks (aka DEP, W\\^X, NX)\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n_[Exploit Exercises Protostar: Stack level 6](Exploit Exercises Protostar: Stack level 6](https://exploit.education/protostar/stack-six/)_\n\n_ret2libc is the first simple bypass of an exploit mitigation and serves as an introduction to the concepts which form the basis of the powerful return oriented programming technique, there are a couple of variants of this technique such as ret2plt or ret2text_\n\n******************************************\n\n# 4: Return Oriented Programming (ROP)\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n_[Exploit Exercises Protostar: Stack level 7](https://exploit.education/protostar/stack-seven/)_\n\n_[/u/d4mianwayne 's ROP Introduction](https://d4mianwayne.github.io/ROP-Introduction/)_\n\n_ROP is a key technique for modern exploitation that can be used to defeat DEP as well as ASLR, and an interesting way to learn about assembler and really start to get in depth with syscalls, registers and other low level fundamentals._\n\n*****************************************\n\n# 5: Defeating stack canaries\n\n_Stack Canaries are an exploit mitigation which seeks to prevent exploits by adding a small check to the end of functions for buffer overflows. They come in a variety of shapes and styles, such as terminator canaries and random canaries. Learning a few techniques to defeat or bypass them is pretty essential._\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\n_[Corelan's notes on this](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/09/21/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-6-bypassing-stack-cookies-safeseh-hw-dep-and-aslr/)_\n\nNote: resources for this seem limited - any suggestions or posts on the subject welcome\n\n*****************************************\n\n# 6: Heap Exploitation Basics\n\n_More modern exploitation focuses around the heap rather than the stack, partially due to the improving state of mitigations for stack based exploits, partially because coding standards have improved and there are fewer opportunities for simple stack smashing._\n\n_**Resources:**_\n\nhttps://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/\n\n*****************************************\n\n# 0xFF: Other Resources\n\n_Sam Bowne is a lecturer for a community college in the San Fransico area who publishes much of his material online, you'll find lecture notes, videos and projects on his website_\n\n* https://samsclass.info/127/127_F19.shtml"

        "content": "In true Reddit fashion, I haven't read the article and I'm going to express my opinion anyway. \n\nThe correct time to use a feature flag is:\n\n - When you need different behavior for different environments. Like if you have different servers for each customer, and you aren't going to turn on features that they haven't paid for yet. There are other ways of doing this, notably just having a separate \"feature service\" that is keyed by customer ID, which you control. \n\n- When you're trying to ascertain whether a change causes subtle issues, and you can't sufficiently test it in dev environments because \"reasons\". Usually shit like \"our dev environment is about three orders of magnitude smaller than our production environment so scale issues never show up there\". If you put it behind a feature flag than you can effectively redeploy without making large (risky) code changes. That being said, this matters *far* more in old, antiquated server designs than it does now, because in most setups I can easily roll back to the last deployed version, and making an environment change is just as expensive as making a code change is. \n\n- When you want to ship code that is intended to be more of a beta, for review of a small chunk of your user population. You can use a feature flag to turn on/off beta features that aren't yet ready for prime time. This is the best use of feature flags that I've seen."

The first 3 \"Always\" are the most memorable and helpful, others help as well though.\n\nI got back into learning German fairly loosely over this Covid season and dug up his old course material that he actually still posts online. [The list of everything gender wise is on page 114](http://w3-o.hm.edu/home/fb/fb13/drblock/germangram.pdf). I definitely found it easier to learn these rules to give me a better opportunity at discovering Gender on my own out in the wild.\n\nI'll  put these rules into an Anki and post it here when I have time today. I'd recommend doing it on your own but at minimum having a premade deck in there will be helpful.\n\nFor now here's it as a reddit post:\n\n#Endings that ALWAYS indicate Gender\n\n**ALWAYS** with little to no exceptions\n\nALWAYS Feminine Endings:\n\n* -heit / keit (en) (zB Gerissenheit)\n* -schaft (zB Wissenschaft)\n* -ung (zB Beratung)\n* -ei (zB Konditorei)\n* exception der Papagei \n\nALWAYS Neutral Endings\n\n* -chen (zB Mädchen)\n* -lein (zB Fräulein)\n\nALWAYS Masculine Endings\n\n* -ling (Frühling)\n* -ig, -ich, -eich, -rich (Käfig, Teppich, Deich, Breich, Enterich) \n* exception das Reich\n\n___\n\n\n**MOSTLY** There's also endings that identify Gender either most of the time or under certain precursors.

And people started talking to me and even invite me to parties and stuff. Suddenly, I had friends!

Competition has left bad reviews, started bad rumors, stolen designs, and tried to get me blacklisted by suppliers. I can only imagine what underhanded techniques and unethical actions that a billionaire needs to take to get to where they are.\n\nEdit: adding on to this: some people seem to think a billionaire gets to where he/she is by being working hard to innovate within their company. What they don’t realize is that there are three more pieces: 1) controlling your workforce, 2) controlling your competition, and 3) controlling your suppliers. \n\n\n1 is doing stuff like anti-union measures, lobbying against minimum wage increases, arguing in court that you’re employees are independent contractors instead of employees. Essentially it’s hard to make a billion dollars without inequitably distributing the wealth that your employees generate. \n\n\n2 is stuff like stealing talent/designs/ideas, blacklisting, frivolous lawsuits and so on. Some may be illegal and some may not be. For example, would it be illegal if the Starbucks game plan was to open a coffee shop next to every Peets coffee?  No, but it’s not very noble either. \n\n\nAnd 3 is stuff like using large bargaining power to give suppliers no choice but meet your terms. Would slave laborer be a thing if there wasn’t this imbalance between supplier and vendor?"

I have been able to focus on more of myself than ever before. \n\nMoney & time are viewed in the same perspective to most people. \"I don't have time to workout\"\n\n\"I don't have money for those AirPods.\" the unique thing is, it's all about desire and discipline, I don't care how busy someone claims they are, we all sleep, choose to wake up 20 minutes early if that means you can walk or get in a quick workout. \n\nIf you have time to scroll social media into this endless abysss of nothing for the next hit of dopamine, if you spend the last few hours of your evening watching Netflix, that is how you manage your time. \n\nStop spending money on useless stuff and you will better yourself. \n\nIm 23 I have a little over $60,000 saved, I make $30,000 a year right now. Im frugal and trying to better myself every day so I can be a better person in the future, I don't need to latest phone or technology, the nicest car. No I don't think im some hierarchy or even let anyone know what I have saved, but too many of my friends or people around me just complain and complain, you are your own person, make your own decisions, change that voice in your head that tells you that you can't, I believe anyone can do it, you are here today from all the decisions you made in the past.\n\nYou can go running for the next week and still be out of shape, its those consistent habits over time that will lead to your success.\n\nPeople choose where they spend their money, yes obviously not everyone has the money for a Mercedes but truly if you wanted it so bad you would eat beans and rice for the next 20 years if that means having money aside to get one. \n\nI set 30-minute windows for all my tasks, I have always been a time freak, I listen to podcasts as I complete these tasks, a pair of Bluetooth headphones, listening to a podcast or audiobook is so great not only are you learning so much but it also keeps your away from that negative voice in your head. \n\nI truly believe what you look for in life you find.\n\nI have always cared about helping others and having an ear to listen, give my advice. I found in doing that I helped myself and by pushing myself to be better I can hopefully help at least one person who reads this.\n\nForget your goals, focus on systems instead. Consistent daily habits and patterns will map your future, not the idea of a beautiful house or the nicest car, your happiness won't be there if that's your point of view. Don't look at the scoreboard so much just play the game, the score will follow.\n\nRead 'Atomic Habits' one of the best books I have read in a while. You can get it for free with a quick PDF search online. To whoever reads this I wish you the best. But the only person who can make the best version in you is yourself, we all have a voice in our head and an intuition, Listen to that voice in your head and be the best you can be."

        "content": "Hi!, I've made Algovis, a python library made for visualizing and analyzing algorithms. As a beginner, I always had trouble visualizing algorithms so I made this very easy to use library to help new python users get started. It has a lot of nice features like printing the code to  terminal and visualizing in reverse. Getting started is extremely easy as well, just 5 lines of code\n\n\\# importing the sorting module\n\nfrom algovis import sorting\n\nimport random\n\nmy\\_list = \\[i + 1 for i in range(100)\\]\n\nrandom.shuffle(my\\_list)\n\n\\# creating an oject of the BubbleSort class and passing the list\n\nbs\\_object = sorting.BubbleSort(my\\_list)\n\n\\#calling the visualize method\n\nbs\\_object.visualize(interval=100)\n\nCurrently the library has\n\n## Sorting\n\n* Bubble Sort\n* Insertion Sort\n* Selection Sort\n* Merge Sort\n* Quick Sort\n\n## Searching\n\n* Linear Search\n* Binary Search\n\nGithub Repo: [https://github.com/hotshot07/algovis](https://github.com/hotshot07/algovis)\n\nDocumentation: [https://algovisdocs.netlify.app](https://algovisdocs.netlify.app/)\n\nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/algovis/](https://pypi.org/project/algovis/)\n\nHappy Coding :)\n\nEDIT: Well this blew up! I'm glad you all liked it and thanks for the award u/Seralyn that made my day! I'm currently messing around with the networkx library, might add some graph algorithms in near future if I get it working. \n\nSome python resources that I really found helpful while learning python were YouTubers Corey Schafer and Dan Bader(his python tricks book is great too). Fluent Python, obviously. For writing good code for this library I used google's style guide which is amazing ([https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)). Just don't read books and follow tutorials try to make something cool and nice you'll learn a lot faster. For 'personal growth' I'd recommend 'Deep Work', by Cal Newport, that is probably the only self-help book you'll ever need for that domain and it works. The best way to learn a language is to take it slow, understand what's happening, think deeply about trivial things and then move forward. \n\nOn a side note, I was having a chat with mum who's halfway across the globe atm and she told me that 26th July 2018 was the day I had a terrible accident on the tennis court (broke 3 of my 4 knee ligaments) because of which I had to leave the university tennis team and was bedridden for about 6 months (add depression, anxiety and all that stuff). On 26th July 2020, exactly 2 years after that incident I release a python library that was trending on r/learnpython.  If you're struggling, things do get better. It just takes time :)"

I'm an electrician who knows applied theory, not physics. I can tell you the resistance of an insulator is really high, but they can tell you what's going on there. To me, a path with high enough resistance (such as air) is not an available path in my formulation above. I was just trying to fix a common misconception... did not expect this much attention.\n\nEdit: high enough resistance to the available voltage isn't an available path,  I should have said."

        "title": "How to: get a software engineering internship at a technology company",
        "content": "Everything below is a synthesis from my experience over the last several years in college. I wrote it up for someone I know who is an underclassman studying computer science at a state university who is interested in trying to get an internship at a competitive technology company. I wanted to put it here because I think it's useful, and I'd be happy knowing others found it useful as well.\n\nTo validate the information I share below, I am a new grad working as a software engineer and just graduated from a strong state school computer science program. Over the last few years, I have interviewed at a majority of the hot tech companies, both large and small, trading firms, been rejected a lot, learned a lot of lessons, and received offers from some of the most \"desirable\" places to work. Unfortunately, the one thing I cannot account for is any bias or privilege due to the school I attended, but I assure you, I did not go to MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, or Berkeley.\n\nThis is a simple set of what I think are the core pieces of information and steps to position yourself to get an internship at a reputable technology company.\n\nCompletely non-jokingly, I think it boils down to two stages, which require completely different areas of preparation and requirements:\n\n1. Getting the interview\n2. Passing the interview\n\n**Getting the interview**\n\n*Note: this section is assuming you have a properly crafted resume. Quite frankly, I am too lazy to write about how to make a good resume, and I think there are plenty of resources online for that.*\n\nFor younger students and students without as much experience, getting interviews at technology companies can present a challenge. However, I think there are a few tips and tricks that can be used to make your life a lot easier.\n\n**Referrals**: this is the undisputed number one way to get an interview at any company. Find a friend that works somewhere, or a friend of a friend, and ask if they'd be willing to refer you or connect you to their recruiter at the company. When possible, referrals should always be the absolute first choice for how to apply to a company. This isn’t just something you ask for when you need it. Throughout your curriculum, try to make friends with your peers, upperclassmen, and surround yourself with people that are strong students--right from your first year. 3 years later, all of those students (including yourself) will have strong internships, and you’ll all be able to help each other out. If you stay in your own small bubble and work through your coursework that way, you’ll be less well off.\n\n**Career fairs:** they work. The line for Google isn't worth it since they just tell you to apply online, but career fairs are worth going to and the lines are generally worth waiting in. It's a few hours of pain for long-term success. Just go. There are also ways to make these conversations more worthwhile. Take some time to talk to some of the shorter-lined companies that still have great programs that you may just not know about. A lot of these can lead to genuinely interesting conversations with an engineer that can lead to an email for you to reach out to later.\n\n**Cold emailing**: in my opinion, cold emailing is very underrated. Outside (or in addition to) career fairs and when you don't have a referral, I think it's the best thing you can do. Your success rate from cold emailing will depend on the timing of which you send the email so that it doesn't get buried in the recruiters inbox, the quality of the email, and how impressive of an applicant you are.\n\nFinding the email of a university recruiter at the company and sending them an email expressing your interest in the company, the work they do, and that you're interested in an internship is a good way to get in contact with a company. I think cold emailing can be as effective as career fairs depending on the company, and it's infinitely better than throwing your resume into the black hole of online applications. In the absolute worst case, you just don't get a response from the recruiter you email. \n\nAn additional note is that I usually apply online to the company around the same time that I send the cold email because there's no reason not to, and sometimes the recruiter could miss your email or forget to respond, but your online application will get picked up and put you into the interview process.\n\nThree questions you might be having at this point are:\n\n1. How do I find the email address for the university recruiter at X company? \n2. What do I put in the cold email?\n3. When should I send it?\n\nLet's answer them separately.\n\nFor question one, I use a gmail plugin called \"Clearbit Connect\". I have found this plugin extremely useful and does everything I need it to do. You can install it easily for gmail, then within gmail, you can search for email addresses of employees at companies by position, very easily letting you find the email address for \"university recruiter Facebook\", if that was your search query.\n\nFor question two, I will include an example email edited for anonymity directly from my inbox that I sent last year when applying for new grad roles. I think there is a key to it to stand out beyond \"I am interested in your company's internship / new grad program.\" You need to specifically mention WHY you are interested in this company. What is it about the work they do, their company culture, etc., that makes you want to apply. I know it's hard to think about that specifically because many times you are just applying to anything and everything, but believe me, finding a way to make it specific to the company, even just a little bit, goes a long long way. \n\nAnyways, onto an example. I sent this email (and included my resume as an attachment) at the end of July 2019 to a recruiter I found through clearbit, inquiring about full-time jobs:\n\n\\---\n\nSubject line: COMPANY NAME New Grad 2020 SWE Interest\n\nHi RECRUITER NAME,\n\nMy name is JOHN SMITH, and I’m a senior in computer science at the University of Anonymous. I’m graduating this year (Spring 2020), and this fall / late-summer I’ll be looking for a full-time software engineering role for after graduation.\n\nI’m currently a software engineering intern at COMPANY A. Previously, I was a software engineering intern at COMPETITOR working on PROJECT.\n\nFrom my time at COMPETITOR, I gained a strong affinity for the type of work done at YOUR COMPANY — particularly working on RELEVANT DOMAIN DETAIL, and I have also heard wonderful things about the environment and culture at YOUR COMPANY.\n\nI’m very interested in starting a conversation about potential full-time roles for after graduation in 2020. I know it’s a little bit early, but since return offers from previous internships will likely have a deadline a few weeks into the school year, I figure it's better to get the ball rolling as soon as possible. Additionally, I went ahead and attached my resume to this email, so that you can learn a little more about me.\n\nI’m excited to start the conversation and learn more about YOUR COMPANY!\n\nBest,\n\nJOHN SMITH\n\n\\---\n\nFor question three, I think emails should be sent so that it arrives in the recruiter's inbox close to the start of the workday (anywhere from 8-9am in their timezone should suffice). You're probably thinking to yourself, do I have to wake up at 8am to send an email? The good news is no, you don't. There is a gmail plugin called Boomerang that lets you write an email and schedule it to be sent at a future time. For example, you can write the email the night before at 9pm and schedule it to automatically send at 8am the next morning, when you're still peacefully asleep.\n\nFor all of the above, again, having a well-prepared resume here is a prerequisite.\n\n**Passing the interview**\n\n95% of technology companies will ask leetcode (leetcode.com) style data structures and algorithms problems. The interview will generally be 45-60 minutes in length and ask 1-2 leetcode style coding questions around the \"medium\" difficulty level. The amount of help you're expected to receive will depend on the company, but generally speaking, you should be able to come up with working code to solve the problem with an optimal time-complexity solution in roughly 30 minutes for a \"medium\" difficulty question without too much assistance. Some interviews might be an exception on the easier side and ask a couple of questions that are more \"easy\" difficulty, and some might ask a question closer to the \"hard\" difficulty.\n\n**What interviewing is actually all about:** You’ll hear people complaining all over about how technical interviewing is bogus and algorithms problems are irrelevant to real world work, etc. One thing to keep in mind is your actual process and discussion with the interviewer. At some companies, solving the problem may be all they care about. But at most places, they are actually very forgiving and want to see how you code and how you approach the problem. Your discussion about trade-offs, your thought process, your verbal communication, your ability to implement once an algorithm is in place--these are all way more important than the actual solving of the problem to most companies. Of course, it’s difficult to focus on these things a lot of the time since many interviewees will get stressed out about solving the problem and not handle it well. It’s mostly important to keep a cool head--start with the dumbest solution you can think of and discuss from there. As long as you can communicate and move forward and keep coming up with ideas and thoughtful genuine technical discussion, the interviewer is likely to think you have good general problem solving ability even if you didn’t come up with a perfect solution right away. With that being said, preparation is still important and that’s discussed more going forward.\n\nMy general view is that technical interviews can be a bit of a crapshoot, and you might be fully qualified to work somewhere, but you just happened to get an interview question that you were unable to solve effectively. That happens sometimes, and all you can do is learn to move on. There are plenty of good technology companies out there. HOWEVER, I think that your goal should be to do sufficient leetcode practice such that you go into an interview comfortable with your programming and problem-solving ability for these kinds of questions, aiming to reduce the performance variance based on any question specifically as much as possible. There is absolutely a pattern to the kinds of questions asked, and you can definitely be in an interview and given a question that is similar to something you have seen before, either in a different interview or in your practice, and it will make the interview substantially easier.\n\nIn my opinion, for internships, if you can comfortably solve arbitrary leetcode \"medium\" difficulty questions in roughly 30 minutes or less with the optimal time-complexity solution, you are good enough at these problems to pass a good amount of technical interviews. As a reference point, by the beginning of my junior year fall, I had solved roughly 100 problems on leetcode (I have currently solved 110 problems). It varies per person, but I think this is generally a reasonable number such that if you hit the right areas, you can go into your interviews feeling confident. If I had to guess, the breakdown of those 100 problems is 30-40 easy questions, 40-50 medium questions, and 5-10 hard questions. I have only come across a \"hard\" difficulty question a handful of times in my interviewing experience, and to be honest, I'm not sure that difficulty level is worth preparing for, at least for internships, since they don't appear very often. However, the bar could be increasing for internships, and companies could start asking harder questions as the field becomes more competitive.\n\nI also want to include that these types of questions are not easy. Even the medium level questions, and some easy ones, can be quite challenging when first starting out. There will definitely be times you struggle very hard and just can't figure out a question, and that's okay. Practice makes perfect, and it's all about practice.\n\nCertain data structures topics come up more often than others in these kinds of interviews. Here is a dump of the topics I think are the most important to focus on. These correspond to the \"Tag\" of the problem type in leetcode (ordered roughly by importance, but all of them are important):\n\n1. Hash table\n2. Tree\n3. Linked list\n4. Array\n5. String\n6. Dynamic programming\n7. Stack\n8. Heap\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions. I'm happy to help."

Come to find out I just have a way higher sex drive than him. This also led to the fun realization that men really like it when you initiate. Another thing I just assumed they didn't like because I just assumed men wanted to be in charge. Needless to say, it hasn't been a problem since I got used to the idea I could jump him. \n\nSo, what things did you just think were true about everyone that you found out from experience was crap?\n\n\nEdit: wow this really blew up. Thank you all for the responses and thank you for the award! Its my first one!"

        "content": "Hmm, kind of a let down. It's literally one step removed from watching a debugger step through an implementation, with no description of *why* any steps are done. The Wikipedia page is hardly more helpful.\n\nHere's my quick attempt at explaining.\n\nLet's look at the initialisation constants. SHA2 is designed by the NSA. However, it's still trusted (vs other algorithms they did which aren't) because it's careful to use \"nothing up my sleeve numbers\". *I believe* the reason it uses the digits of cube roots of primes is somewhat arbitrary - the designers wanted values that are basically random but which nobody can argue has a hidden back doors. This sort of thing is common in cryptography, other algorithms may use digits of pi or other such values. That said, as I was writing this post I tried to find some confirmation of this and as always with NSA-originated cryptography, there are no explanations of why these numbers were selected anywhere. The rather odd construction here actually does raise questions in my mind as to why cube roots of primes were selected instead of some other more natural set of constants.\n\nSHA2 is based on a concept called the Merkle-Dåmgard construction. Most modern hash functions are built on this concept, except I believe SHA3 ~~and candidates~~. There's no theoretical reason for this - SHA3 wasn't created because SHA2 is weak ~~or has any known problems~~. Rather the desire was for a function that had a different theoretical basis than the current dominant paradigm, in case one day someone discovers the MD construction is in fact flawed. \n\nHash functions produce a constant size output given arbitrary sized input. Several of the steps are related to that fact. The MD construction is an iterative construction that takes a \"compression function\" and a stream of data. Then:\n\n1. The stream is chunked and fed into the compression function combined with the previous output of the compression function, or for the first block, the initialisation vector (more arbitrary random junk).\n2. Because the input stream is chunked, the final chunk has to be padded with zeros. But that would mean two streams where one has some zeros on the end would hash to the same value if the lengths didn't cross into another block, which would violate the properties of a good hash function. So a 1 bit is appended to the stream, to ensure two streams of different lengths always yield different blocks. The length is mixed into the hashed data for the same reason. It's placed right at the end to allow hashing functions to be treated as a stream: this way you know the last 64 bits of the last block have the length in it. You don't need to know the size up front.\n3. There is a nice proof that if the compression function is collision resistant, so is the arbitrary-length hash function built using the MD construction. This is one reason why it's popular.\n\nAll that stuff is standard and worked out by others outside the NSA. \n\nSo what about the compression function? The goal of this function is essentially to spread the input bits out over the output bits and combine them together, in such a way that changing one bit of the input yields a change in approximately half the output bits. This is called the \"avalanche effect\" and - combined with the iterative feed-forward nature of the MD construction, is why changing a single bit of a message yields a totally different hash.\n\nCompression function design is a bit more of an art than a science, but as everyone agrees on what a good one looks like, it's suitable for a competition - which is why SHA3 wasn't designed by the NSA but rather via open access competition of the sort that gave the world AES.\n\nSome of the principles are actually shared between hash functions and ciphers. A block cipher can be turned into a compression function usable for hash functions using the Davies-Meyer construction. SHA2 is essentially the combination of the MD construction and the \"SHACAL-2\" block cipher.\n\nSo as you can see, SHA2 is the result of combining some well known \"publicly random\" constants with some generic functional transformations of functions: the MD construction and the DM construction, which take as input a block cipher and convert it into a streaming hash function resistant to various known attacks.\n\nThis leads to the question of how the block cipher works. And I'm afraid there I must leave you until next time. Block cipher construction is basically the result of over 1000 years of evolution, starting with simple military codes like a Caeser cipher and ending in AES. There are no mathematical proofs that any of this works. It just seems to work and seems to be hard, based on the fact that lots of people would love to break them but apparently haven't managed."

If you look at the notes i done so far, I started with kubernetes and the writing is rather poor (although i rewrote that entirely at least 3 times) as i was getting used to the software + ipad pro pencil. I also been looking at my notes on different devices to see how legible it is. my other notes have white on black and its painful to read - i need to fix them still. \n\nThe way i did the ML notes. I actually took these notes on the train to work and i ended up porting it all over to this app and then doing the graphics. I think this is the better way. \n\nGenerally i watch a course and i pause and make notes each step of the way. I will then go through them all again cutting it down or adding to make it ‘make sense’. I’m pretty used to this as ive been doing it for 10 years. I have notes all over the place. Although it is lots of effort, its worthwhile in the end. You read the notes over and over until it builds memory muscle and also you get something more productive i guess? Its not just scribble or random stuff you put down. \n\nThe courses i am doing now, vault / jenkins etc.. it can take me 1 hour to watch a 10 minute video... not always that slow lol but while i build momentum into a course and find what style to put the information back so it lands with me, can take time. \n\nIn the end it all depends on you and how you learn. I do this personally because i can, there is not enough hours in the day to study but i cant really write blogs for example, i struggle - im rubbish at that. \n\nSo whatever you decide, i think main thing is the ability to maintain it.\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CBnlXjmgCF7/?igshid=u20yi3pe5j4o <— snippet of me doing the kubernetes one"

His actions couldn't be more suspicious if he tried.\n\n- He meets with Putin repeatedly without note-takers and has gone to extensive lengths to block all recorded conversations between them. \n- He defended Putin over his own intelligence agencies at Helsinki. \n- He vetoed UNANIMOUS Congressional sanctions against Russia.\n- He wants them back in the G8.\n- He leaks confidential military information to them.\n- He extorted Ukraine out of military aid they desperately needed to defend U.S. allies against Russia.  \n- He has sent Barr on a mission 'cross the world to get foreign countries to discredit the Mueller investigation.  \n- Barr would not accept the IG findings on the Mueller report, and has another investigator trying to discredit the report.\n- He offered support for Russian wildfires in Siberia while ignoring those in the U.S.\n- He offered Russia ventilators while downplaying supplies for COVID-19 in the U.S.\n- His DOJ has dropped charges against the 13 Russian nationals. \n- He constantly attacks and disagrees with every intelligence official that says anything negative about Russia.\n- He almost never criticizes Putin.\n- He follows Russian propaganda techniques and targets common cultural divides that Russia invokes.\n- He is implicated in direct dealings with Russia by a British spy who the DOJ found \"credible and surprising.\"\n- He pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project until the election.\n- The Deutche bank questions / tax return hiding / history of money laundering.\n- Manafort Russian connections\n- Flynn Russian connections\n- He has McConnell and the GOP lock-step in blocking election security against Russia.\n- He refused to admonish Russia for putting bounties on U.S. soldiers via the Taliban.\n\nThese are just things off the top of my head. We are going to learn a LOT in the coming years and decades.\n\nEdit: Sorry guys, as stupid as I think Trump is, I'm not buying the theories that Trump being an egotistical simpleton explains all this. I think the most plausible theory involves finances, specifically his connections to Deutsche Bank, who is under criminal investigation and have been waist-deep in Russian money laundering for years. That would explain appealing his tax returns to the Supreme Court, Manafort/Stone/Flynn/etc connections, him and his family history of Russian connections, and why Deutsche Bank loaned him $2.5 billion over decades when few others would.\n\nIt could very well be the case that 1) Trump is worth FAR less than he claims, 2) is actually indebted to Russia financially, and 3) him, his family, and associates have a litany of clear-cut financial felonies. That information alone is plenty for Russia to leverage Trump to their advantage. Which then probably compounds the issues into election interference, extorting countries for political favors, politically charged pardons/commutations, and other impeachable offenses (and crimes)."

They just see it as a habit they want to break.\n\nThis is evidenced by the stubborness of many, relying purely on willpower for months, only to constantly reset their counters and beat themselves up for not making any progress.\n\nMost people don't realize how incredibly difficult it is to completely remove artificial stimulation (of any kind) for the rest of their lives. We're talking about years and years of brain conditioning here.\n\nWe're dealing with some powerful stuff here, but it is not treated seriously enough, probably because it's widely accepted by society and is not a substance like heroine or cocaine.\n\nI cringe when people relapse, reset their counters, and proclaim \"This is it, I've had enough, I'm going to do it this time\"...\n\nStop kidding yourself.\n\nThis is an addiction that has to be attacked from many different angles.

That is not recovering.**\n\nIt is extremely common for people to achieve a certain milestone, such as 30, 90, or 100 days, relapse a few days later, and then find themselves unable to get momentum again. They go back to the beginning and they feel like they lost all their progress from their run.\n\nThere is a constant frustration for lack of progress. People are feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, trying the same thing over and over again without success.\n\nThis is because very few are addressing the real roots of their problems. Very few.\n\nEveryone is focused on how many days they have managed and if their symptoms are either present or gone. They judge their progress by measuring dick hardness, spontaneous erections and morning woods.\n\nThey are \"trying to quit porn\" so that they can \"get rid of their ED\".\n\nSo they abstain for as long as they can, hoping that this can cure their symptoms.\n\n**Completely wrong approach.**\n\nIf they don't see ED improvements, they get discouraged.\n\nIf they see ED improvements, then maybe a porn session or two won't hurt, right?\n\nIf there is no woman around, they justify watching a couple of times. After all, they are not having sex anytime soon, so whats the point?\n\nThey delay dating until their ED is cured or they have managed to go 100 days. But they never achieve this in the first place precisely because of this incorrect mentality.\n\nThe same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety, energy levels, motivation, etc.\n\nThey try to quit porn, so that the symptoms can go away, and so they can finally live life.\n\nPeople are focusing on the wrong things.\n\nThey are not changing the way they think.\n\nThey are not changing the way they live.\n\nThey are not changing the way they view sex and women.\n\nThey are just trying not to masturbate, while everything else remains the same.\n\nThat, my friends, is abstinence, not recovery.\n\nThe Foundation of a Proper Reboot\n\n**Porn addiction is not the cause of your shitty life.**\n\nRead that again.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to improve your life when you're having intense porn sessions every single day that drain your energy and make you a zombie. But porn is not the reason your life sucks.\n\nPlease, this is very important to understand, you have to stop blaming porn for your problems.\n\nThis mentality of *life awaits me after recovery* is destructive.\n\nPorn is not the reason you're a procrastinator. Porn is not the reason you're depressed. Porn is not the reason you're lonely. Porn is not the reason you haven't been able to lose weight or gain muscle.\n\n**Porn is the symptom.**\n\nYou watch porn to escape reality. You watch porn to manage your emotions. You watch porn because you're bored, lonely, stressed, depressed, angry, isolated. You watch porn to feel good for a moment, to replace uncomfortable emotions and situations in your life.\n\nHere's how you get rid of this addiction:\n\nYou don't focus on quitting porn so you can finally get to live life after you're recovered.\n\nYou focus on learning how to live, how to manage your emotions, how to change the way you think and view the world.\n\nYou put all your energy into building the life you want.\n\nThis will naturally lead your mind away from porn.\n\nSuccess is not measured by how many clean days you've managed.\n\nIt's measured by how much your life has improved since you started rebooting.\n\nThis is what you need to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #1: Write a life vision for yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you envision your life a few weeks, months, or years from now?\n\nSpend a whole day (or week) thinking about this.\n\nDon't say *I don't know what to do with my life*.\n\nAre you telling me you have no clue what you want in any of the following areas: study, work, family, friends, hobbies, health, etc.?\n\nEven if you're not sure, you need to give your life some direction.\n\nThis is by far the most important part of recovering from pornography addiction.\n\nWrite like crazy. Write many pages if you want. Make the biggest post you've ever done in your journal talking about how you envision your future life.\n\nThis life vision will be the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThis is what you will focus on 100% from now on.\n\nClose your eyes. Visualize it. Write it down.\n\nIf you don't know what you want in life, then this is actually a more serious issue than porn addiction itself.\n\nLike I said, spend a whole week if you need to.\n\nBrainstorm.\n\nAsk for advice.\n\nTake a notebook and go to a park.\n\nInspire yourself.\n\nThis is the beginning of your recovery.\n\n**Take it seriously.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #2: Give urgency to your life vision\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, now you know what you want in life. Even if you're still unsure in some areas, such as not knowing what to study, that's ok. At least you can give your life some direction for the moment. This is very important. You need to give your life direction. You need to move towards something.\n\nHere's the problem. Many of us know what we want, but we keep delaying it. We're experts at delaying goals. We wait until New Years, or the beginning of a month, or until circumstances get better.\n\nSo this is what you're going to do now:\n\nYou're going to give urgency to your life vision.\n\nWrite down why you ABSOLUTELY MUST start working on it right now.\n\nMake another huge post or journal entry about it.\n\nLet's suppose you're 27 and you have no job, no car, still live with your parents, and spend most of the day playing video games. Why in the world would you wait more time before starting to do something about it? This is urgent bro. You're fucking 27!\n\nOr maybe you've never had a girlfriend in your life before. Well, what are you waiting for? Go buy some nice clothes, start going out more frequently, make mistakes, get rejected, ask women on dates. Start getting some experience NOW.\n\nYou have back pain? Start working on it. Don't wait. The more you wait the worse it gets. Start doing yoga or swimming. Move your hips and back constantly every day.\n\nWrite down reasons why you must start pursuing your life vision right now.\n\nYou have to stop living like this.\n\nThis is urgent.\n\nThis is high priority.\n\nWe must convince ourselves that change is imminent.\n\nIt's very important.\n\nA life vision is no good if you have no urgency.\n\nYou'll just keep delaying it. Waiting for circumstances to improve. Waiting for motivation to arrive. Waiting for the beginning of new year.\n\n**Create urgency.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step #3: Develop an indestructible belief in yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the main reasons we quit goals is because deep inside we don't believe we're actually able to do it.\n\nWhen successful people like Arnold Schwarzenegger decide they want to achieve something, they become completely obsessed about it. They have an indestructible belief that they will achieve it.\n\nThey are not affected by circumstances. They create results in their head before they even get them.\n\nThis is what you have to do if you want to accomplish anything.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to learn how to play guitar. And you have the urgency to do it, because you know it takes time, so the sooner you start the better. You have to start now.\n\nHowever, after a few days of learning the basics, you start losing motivation and becoming discouraged. You realize that playing guitar is not easy at all. You feel overwhelmed by how much practice you need to put into it. You start doubting yourself and thinking \"There's no way I'll ever become a great guitar player and form my own band\". Friends tell you things like \"Dude, you should've started years ago. All great guitarists started when they were young\".\n\nSo you quit.\n\nThis is a result of a weak belief in yourself. You don't believe you have the potential to become a good guitarist. Which is obviously completely false. We as humans have unlimited potential.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger doesn't think like this.\n\nLook at what he said:\n\nHow many times have you heard 'You can't do this', 'You can't do that', 'It's never been done before'. I love it when someone says ' No one has ever done this before', because when I do it, that means I'm the first person that's ever done it!\n\nThis is how we should think when we set up to do anything in life.\n\nUncertainty is what kills people. Not knowing if they're able to achieve it.\n\nWe need to brainwash ourselves every day into believing that we WILL do it NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nAll of these steps are equally important.\n\nDo not skip them.\n\nThey are the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThey make rebooting so much easier. Your mind will be completely focused on what you want in life. You will be fixing the root of all your problems.\n\nThe secret of change is to focus all your energy not fighting the old, but on building the new.\n\nStop making posts complaining about your shitty life. Stop making posts saying how you're sick of being addicted to porn. Stop talking about porn altogether.\n\nInstead, transform your journal into a self-improvement journal, focused 100% on moving towards the life you want.\n\n**\"Forget\" about porn.**\n\nThis is basic rebooting stuff, yet many people are constantly breaking this rule. They write about porn cravings, morning woods, spontaneous erections, what day they're on, how much they struggled to abstain, how they can't wait to reach 90 days, etc.\n\nWhen you consistently focus 100% on building the life you want, your mind will naturally move away from porn. You will also lessen the void left by quitting porn, which is very real.\n\nMany people quit porn only to find themselves in this life emptiness that is very hard to handle. Then they go back to porn precisely because this void is too much for them.\n\nFocusing on your life vision is a superior rebooting approach.\n\nRelapses aren't that discouraging if you're actually improving your life. Ironically, you will notice that the more you focus on what you want, the less frequently you will relapse.\n\nIt's important that you think in terms of life vision and pursuing your dreams, not in terms of \"I have to get busy and fill my life with activities so that I don't watch porn\". This is something you're doing for yourself.\n\nStop ranting about porn.\n\n**This journey is about your LIFE.**\n\nFocus on that and the porn will go away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Managing Your Emotional Life\n\n# \n\nOk, let's keep going.\n\nPorn addiction is much more than just getting cravings and relapsing.\n\nOne of the reasons we become addicted is because of our inability to manage our emotional lives.\n\nYou have to remind yourself that quitting porn is about growing up and becoming a much more mature person.\n\nIt's much more than *I want to quit porn so I can cure ED and have plenty of sex with women!*.\n\nMuch more than that.\n\nWe've been using porn for years as a method of handling our emotions.\n\nWe need to stop hiding away from uncomfortable life situations. We need to stop using porn in order to escape from reality.\n\nWe must learn how to handle life and emotions without the need of porn.\n\nWe need to understand that one of the reasons we relapse is because we're pussies that can't handle negative emotions.\n\nWe use porn as medication. We use porn to hide away from life. We use porn to temporarily relief anxiety, stress, loneliness, boredom, anger, etc.\n\nReadjusting Your Sexual Expectations\n\nThis is by far one of the most difficult things to do.\n\nWhen you quit porn, you're not just saying good bye to artificial stimulation.\n\nYou're leaving behind the world of \"never ending flow of hot chicks with big tits and round asses\".\n\nReal life is nothing like that.\n\nWe've been spoiled by porn. We believe that we should be out there having lots of sex with different women. We believe that this is the key to happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThe problem is that it is incredibly difficult and unrealistic to \"fuck hot chicks on a regular basis\".\n\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with having that goal, but you have to be willing to take some MASSIVE action. You have to go through hundreds of rejections. You need to have a lot of balls. **You must do what 99.9% of men are incredibly afraid to do.**\n\nHow many people here are doing what it takes to have the kind of sexual life we all dream about?\n\nVery few, if any. We see these super hot chicks on tight dresses and we hope that maybe someday we might be able to have sex with them. We read books about seduction. We visit PUA forums. We watch videos on YouTube of guys approaching girls. We make theories and discuss them online.\n\nBut we aren't doing shit about it.\n\nIt's all just a dream. An idea we have in our minds. Something we hope someday we will do.\n\nHere's how most people get laid in real life:\n\nA guy meets a girl he finds attractive, so he asks her out. They get to know each other. Then they continue to go out and form some sort of relationship. Then after some months the relationship either becomes serious or falls apart.\n\nThat's the real world.\n\nYou have to accept that, unless you're willing to take massive action, you won't fuck anywhere near as many women as you expect to.\n\n**Accepting this is very difficult, but it is necessary.**\n\nWe need to learn how to live without this world of endless hot chicks, otherwise we'll become extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with real life, which is nothing like porn.\n\nAnyone here is more than capable of getting a girlfriend. But our girlfriends most likely won't look like pornstars, nor they will act like them.\n\nThere's a very high probability the sex won't be pornographic in nature. There's going to be a lot of sensuality, caressing, and also clumsiness. Some days your girl will look sexy, other days not so much. Some days she'll be in the mood, other days she won't. Some days you'll struggle to keep it hard, other days you'll cum too fast. She might be able to achieve orgasms, or she might not. You might do it every other day, or maybe only 3-4 times per month.\n\nRemember, pornstars are paid thousands of dollars to do what they're told and fulfill all your fantasies.\n\n**You must stop living in dream land.**\n\nI know this is very difficult to accept, but we have to give meaning to our lives outside fucking hot chicks.\n\nOur happiness cannot depend on that. Otherwise you'll keep coming back to porn every time you fail to get laid in real life. You will remain attached to \"sex with hot chicks\" for the rest of your life. You have to change the way you view sex and women, because I can assure you it has been completely distorted by porn.\n\nBy the way, I don't believe there's anything wrong about pursuing casual sex instead of a relationship, just make sure you keep both feet on the ground.\n\nI would also like to add that relationships are about sharing your life with another person. I know many people here want a girlfriend so that they can finally start getting laid, but relationships go much more deeper than that.\n\nIf you've never had a girlfriend before you'll know once you get one.\n\nThinking About Sex is USELESS\n\nWhat's the point of fantasizing?\n\nIt accomplishes nothing.\n\nIt slows down the reboot, increases the urge to masturbate, and reinforces neurological pathways related to porn.\n\nIt's a meaningless activity that should be eliminated.\n\nIt keeps your mind focused on sex, tits, asses, fucking, when it should be shifted towards other activities in life.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about sex, you should mindfully and calmly redirect your attention to something else.\n\nYou want sex?\n\nGreat.\n\nThen do something to actually make it happen.\n\nFantasizing by itself serves no purpose at all.\n\nYou need to understand that if you want to abstain from orgasm and masturbation, you cannot be thinking about sex and women, because this will inevitably cause you to relapse. Trying to abstain while at the same time fantasizing or peeking at pictures of chicks will only lead to frustration.\n\nStay away from any kind of artificial stimulation. Don't take peeks. Don't browse pictures of girls online. Don't type pornstar names on Google image search. Don't read escort forums.\n\n**Do not arouse yourself.**\n\nBasically you have to adopt a philosophy of \"I'm either trying to get laid (approaching, texting girls, going out on dates, flirting with women, hanging out with friends, getting rejected) or doing something completely unrelated to sex (work, studying, exercise, fun, reading, playing an instrument, chores, housework, watching movies)\".\n\nThere is no grey area where you are alone thinking about sex or checking out girls online. This accomplishes nothing. It serves no real purpose. It will only increase urges, lead to relapse, and make you frustrated.\n\nAs soon as erotic thoughts pop up in your mind, you should calmly ignore them and refocus your attention to something else. You keep practicing this forever until you master it.\n\nYou have to attack this addiction right from the root. Trying to abstain from hardcore porn accomplishes nothing if you're still constantly fantasizing and peeking.\n\nIf you keep strengthening the mindset I talked about above, you will be making meaningful progress.\n\nThis used to be called \"Monk Mode\", but I don't like that name because it implies that you're going to become celibate.\n\nThis isn't about becoming celibate. This is about doing what it takes if you want to get laid, instead of wasting mental energy on sexual thoughts that will only improve the chances of relapsing.\n\nIf you ever want to achieve a long streak, you can't be checking out girls online, even if it's just some bikini pictures. You can't be fantasizing when you wake up in the morning. You can't be taking 5 second peeks at porn.\n\nAs soon as you do any of those things, this huge beast called porn addiction will take control over your prefrontal cortex and it's just a matter of time before you relapse.\n\nYou have to be extreme.\n\nBut don't worry, it's much easier than it sounds.\n\nIt's actually harder to stop yourself from relapsing once you're already thinking about sex, than it is to not think about sex in the first place.\n\nHow do you not think about sex?\n\nSimple.\n\n**Focus your mind 100% on your life vision.**\n\nEvery....single....day.\n\nDismissing erotic thoughts as soon as they arrive in your mind is the cornerstone for preventing relapses.\n\nThis is basic stuff guys.\n\nIt's Not Orgasm What You Crave\n\nMany people here believe that abstaining from orgasm is the most difficult part of rebooting.\n\n**WRONG.**\n\nWhen you get porn cravings, your brain is not asking for orgasm. As an addict, it is begging you for your hit. It misses the high, the tits, the asses, the novelty, the rush, the unrealistic sexual scenarios, the fantasies, the super hot chicks, the perfect camera shots, the feeling of letting go and indulging in pleasure, the fucking, the cumshots, the doggystyles, the boobs bouncing around, etc.\n\nIf lack of orgasm was the problem, then everyone would just fap without porn (or any other artificial stimulation). There would be no relapses and everyone would have 500+ day counters.\n\nThe urge to ejaculate only becomes a real problem once you start peeking, edging or fantasizing constantly. When you find yourself in a state of arousal then obviously you will want to cum.\n\nBut the initial urges are \"addiction urges\". They are mental. They are not a physical need for ejaculation.\n\nIf you feed these urges by peeking, even if it's just pictures of hot babes in bikini, then they will invade your mind and rob you of your ability to concentrate or remain calm. Eventually \"autopilot\" mode will be engaged and we all know what happens next.\n\n**You're not having urges to cum.**\n\n**You're having urges for a \"high\" and a \"rush\".**\n\nRemember that.\n\nThis is why porn urges don't go away when you get a girlfriend.\n\nIt is a drug, and you need to learn how to live without it, regardless of whether you have a girlfriend or not.\n\nWhen you abstain for several days or weeks, your sensitized pathways are anxiously waiting for any sexual cue, no matter how short or brief. This is why people mistakenly confuse real libido with porn cravings. They take a peek at porn after 15 days and they feel this intense rush and urge to cum, so they conclude that it is libido and that they must relieve pressure.\n\nThe problem was taking a peek in the first place. Had they just focused on more important things instead, they would've been able to finish the day clean without problem.\n\nIf you manage to completely abstain from fantasizing and checking out chicks online (in any form), then going a long time without orgasm won't be a problem.\n\nAnd don't even think about testing or caressing your dick.\n\n**Focus 100% on your life vision.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Counters vs Spreadsheets\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following advice is aimed particularly towards those members who are having trouble getting a good run. If you're already doing good, you can skip this section.\n\nOk, here's the thing:\n\nThere is a sickening obsession with long streaks on this forum.\n\nPeople like counters because supposedly they are helpful for tracking progress.\n\nWell, guess what? Spreadsheets do a much better job at that.\n\nThere's a reason why I'm so stubborn with this anti-counter thing.\n\nThey are dangerous, destructive, counterproductive.\n\nCounters reinforce the idea of being \"back to zero\" every time you relapse, making it way more justifiable to binge before starting over again. Not only that, but you completely lose track of how many times you're actually masturbating. They don't show the whole picture. There is absolutely no way to measure your progress at all. It's a never ending cycle of abstaining for a few days and then going back to zero.\n\nEvery time you reset your counter you become increasingly discouraged and unmotivated.\n\nThere's too much emphasis on what day you're on, no fap challenges (there are currently 7 no fap challenges running, it's ridiculous), 90 days, 100 days, etc.\n\nIf you're consistently unable to get past XX days and you're always in the low numbers, then your counter has lost its purpose.\n\nCounters are only good when you've managed a good run, because this gives you a sense of accomplishment and provides sufficient accountability to actually prevent relapses sometimes.\n\nNow, let's talk about spreadsheets:\n\n\\- They keep your addiction under control: By keeping track of how many times you're actually masturbating and having orgasms, you will be forced to keep it in the low numbers. If you relapse, the spreadsheet will discourage you to binge, especially when you're sharing it with the forum. A good rule of thumb is to try to keep your orgasm count to less than 5 per month.\n\n\\- They allow you to see the full picture. In gameover's words: \"You don't realise how you forget over a month how many times you actually masturbate, peek, pmo or orgasm until you have it in front of you. I thought i was well under 3-4 orgasms a month but I have been up around 6-7 and this month was no better.\" You'll be surprised at how many times you're actually fapping.\n\n\\- They completely eliminate the \"counting\" factor. All you have to do is keep it as clean as you can. Pretty cool eh? No more counting, no more 90 day goals, no more fap challenges. After all, we're trying to quit porn for life, not just 100 days or whatever.\n\n\\- They will never discourage you. If you do relapse, you input it on the spreadsheet and move on. You don't make a new thread called \"Relapsed again\" or \"Not making any progress\". Trust me, if you went from fapping 25 times per month to 2-3 times per month, you're making huge progress, even if your counter only says \"6 days\".\n\nSpreadsheets are NOT a taper off approach, of course. The goal should always be to never watch porn, to be as clean as you can, to take it one day at a time.\n\nTapering off, as in \"I watched porn 20 times last month, so I'll watch it 15 times this month\", will never work. You should never think like this. You should never give yourself the green light to PMO.\n\nIdeally, you should replace your counter with a spreadsheet and completely forget about what day you're on. Then, if you do manage to get on a good run, you can put your counter back up for accountability and motivational purposes.\n\nHowever, I understand many people here are in love with their counters.\n\nThey look pretty.\n\nThey are fancy.\n\nI get it, I get it.\n\nSo this is what I propose:\n\n(Once again, this ONLY applies to people who are struggling. If you're already on day 70 or whatever then don't change anything, but consider using a spreadsheet if you do end up relapsing.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, the typical rebooting advice of *Hey man, just do a 90 day reboot* is basically useless.\n\nThis is a very serious addiction and should be treated as such.\n\nWillpower alone won't do it.\n\nChange the way you live.\n\nChange the way you think.\n\nAnd please, stop making so many posts about porn, cravings, urges, relapsing, erections, 90 days, etc.\n\nInstead, **focus on the most important thing:**\n\n**Your life.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGotta clarify some things:\n\nI have never said that the reason we started watching porn was because of life problems. In fact, I would argue that is not the case for the majority of us.\n\nI didn't have any childhood issues or family problems when I was young. I just discovered porn on my own and liked it because it was very pleasurable. As kids and teenagers we are curious and horny.\n\nHowever, as years go by, we become dependent on it not only because of its extreme addictive nature and accessibility, but also because we start using it as a way to cope with life.\n\nThe reason we start using porn and the reason we continue to use porn once we're addicts aren't necessarily the same.\n\nI also didn't mean to say that all porn addicts have shitty lives. Actually by shitty all I mean is being dissatisfied in one way or another. Maybe you constantly put off your goals. Or maybe you waste a lot of time online and want to change that. That doesn't mean your life is shit. It just means it could be better.\n\nI am completely aware there are exceptions. There is a guy who told me he had no problems getting instant makeouts and fucking chicks the same day he meets them. There are others who actually have incredibly busy lives and only watch porn to get some pleasure and relax.\n\nWhatever your situation is, the main point of my post still stands. You should focus on moving towards what you want, instead of constantly complaining and wasting lots of energy on staying away from porn.\n\n**Concentrate on building the life you dream about and this will help you tremendously on your quest to overcome your addiction to porn.**"

That meant that I was the one treating the friendship as disposable and not putting the work into cultivating our relationship. It was, ironically, a slightly selfish attitude on my part.

Really productive even.\n\nThen you move on to tackle a real world problem, and you hit the borrow checker. Every pattern you've learned from Java or C# or Python just turns into a pile of `Rc` and `RefCell`. Your pace slows down, and you get demoralized. Rust sucks, and you can't understand why anyone likes it.\n\nThen, after beating your head against the borrow checker for a week or two, _you get it_. It all makes sense. You start to wonder how anyone ever manged to write decent code in other languages. You become a full fledged member of the Rust Evangelist Strike Team, and you use Rust for every program, no matter what.\n\nYou keep at it for a year, then two. Everything just flows and you can write Rust effortlessly. Rust is still your tool of choice, but only where it makes the most sense.  You can see the flaws in the language, and muse about how they'll get solved. You start to wonder if those haskell folks were right all along, but you never bother to check.\n\nAt least that's how it's been for me."

It’s tremendous to be a young person and already be skilled in python/programming. You will set yourself up for a really lucrative and secure job in the future. Great work, it’s not easy to learn and you’ve taught yourself. That’s tremendous.\n\n2. Nobody will just hand you the keys to a golden idea of spouting money. If it was as easy as just asking a question, and somebody giving you tons of great ideas to make money, why wouldn’t everyone do it?\nThat’s why you see the question gets asked all the time. It’s hard to find money making ideas for your skills, and harder to execute. That’s why not everyone does it.\n\nSo that leaves us with your question: how do you find money making ideas using python?\n\nAnswer: solve a problem. Look for a solution to something and try to find it out there. If you can’t find it, that’s a great idea to built. Maybe it’s not plausible. Maybe it is. Maybe it fails, maybe it doesn’t. A big part of business is trying and failing- so don’t get discouraged if your first 5, 10, 20 projects don’t make any money. All you need is to find a few that do and go after it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nMaking money on your own requires ingenuity, and the technical know how to actually build a product to solve a problem. Sounds like you might have the latter, so work on the former. It will be hard and nobody is going to hold your hand and lead you to wealth. You must learn to rely on yourself and you’ll succeed- in both python and life.\n\nI’ll get off my soapbox now :). Sorry for formatting on mobile"

        "title": "Just ended a recent job search as a pretty average mid-level developer. Here's how it went",
        "content": "## Overview\n\nLittle bit about me: I am a Software Engineer living in Boise, Idaho. Here’s my resume [on google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_gQeO15QkA3p9q6Tpaz3T_yGCBxdfKx/view?usp=sharing). I previously worked at CPA Global working on enterprise java applications, with a good amount of AWS thrown into the mix. I started looking due to some issues with the remote DevOps team; I was essentially doing double duty due to the fact that the DevOps professional did not show up for (remote) work. That professional was in a different division than me and was friends with his boss, so he basically got away with everything while I picked up the slack. While I’m not adverse to doing work, it was frustrating seeing someone else collect a paycheck for my work.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk on here about career prospects from FAANG developers living in huge tech hubs. I’m not that guy. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to be that guy. I’ve made it to the onsite round at FAANGs multiple times, but I never got it quite right.\n\nWhile I still obviously want to push myself in terms of my career, I had to be honest going into this job search: Going for a Big-N company was a pipe dream, and I should focus on more realistic prospects during my job search.\n\nI’d also like to take this time to apologize if it seems humblebraggy. I went back and forth whether to post this, and ultimately decided to post on the idea that more information is always better, even if said information is a bit annoying.\n\n## My Job Search Methodology\n\nDue to the small selection of roles locally, I decided to consider both local and 100% remote positions. I chose the shotgun approach. Every weekday, I would apply to as many jobs as I could for thirty minutes. If an application was taking longer than 5 minutes, I would abandon it. I altered between three websites: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed.\n\n## Results\n\nI started my job search on May 11th 2020. I finished my search on July 2nd 2020. In this time I applied to 221 jobs. While I don’t have exact numbers in front of me, roughly 10% of those applications resulted in any kind of positive response. From there, my results were more positive. Ultimately, I received three offers (and withdrew from five prospects once I ended my search). These offers were:\n\n* A Government Contracting Company - Note the position was full time, but the company itself receives federal government contracts. I actually received a contingent offer about three weeks into my search, but it required me to go through government clearance. Because I didn’t view that as a guarantee (I smoked weed in college and was cited for minor in possession of alcohol by Ames PD), I kept looking\n* A Seattle based startup - This one was a bit disappointing. The job posting listed a much higher salary than what I ended up getting offered. Not like “low end of the range”, but like half as much as what was listed. I think there was some miscommunication. Either way, we couldn’t come to an agreement on compensation.\n* An LA based startup - This is the offer I ended up taking. Compensation was actually above what I was expecting, it seemed to have a good work/life balance, and it’s 100% remote so I can eventually move if I want to.\n\n## Salary\n\nSo usually salary posts here are humblebrags. I apologize if it comes off this way. I’m excited so it’s hard to write without a bit of that leaking over. While I’m really happy with the results, but they’re still not anything compared to big city or big-N salaries. Part of the reason I live in Boise (also it’s absolutely gorgeous) is to attempt to mitigate the non top-tier salary with a lower cost of living. Anyway:\n\nPrevious Job - 100k base, 6% 401k match, possible 10% bonus (was 3% last year, likely to be even lower this year), HSA health plan.\n\nNew Job - 140k base, 5% 401k match, no bonus, PPO health plan.\n\nI get there’s probably a lot of big city based developers giggling about how I can be excited about that, but you gotta realize it’s essentially a forty percent increase for me. That’s a big deal for me.\n\n## Some Observations\n\n* Only a small number of companies asked any coding questions, and most of those are things I would consider an “easy” level on leetcode. This was a bit of a disappointment as I’ve spent a lot of time grinding those types of problems. In the future, I plan to spend this time on coding projects.\n* There were a LOT of questions about AWS. I was able to answer them well (ironically due to the reason I was leaving my current position), but it’s still surprising how much interest there was in DevOps technologies considering I was going mostly for traditional developer positions.\n* There were a considerable amount of questions concerning application design and architecture. I like those vs leetcode style questions because I feel they much more accurately reflect skills required to be a successful developer.\n* My success was much higher in June than it was in May. I think that companies who were able to weather the pandemic have started hiring again, at least tepidly.\n* While I essentially only had a 1% application to offer rate, it was a lot easier to create a generic resume and shotgun it out than it would have been to research and pinpoint specific companies and tailor my resume. 9/10 would spam again.\n* The job search led to a LOT of phone screens and video interviews. If I wasn’t working remote due to covid 19, It would have been a lot more difficult to conduct these interviews\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI know I’m not top-tier and my approach was heavy handed, but I got a big raise in a relatively short matter of time during an economic downturn. I call this a win."

        "content": "Hello All,\n\nI am fairly inexperienced with programming in general (I've been a hobbyist as a student for about 5 years now), and have experimented with a lot of different types of programming, using different programming languages and different technologies. One thing I have gravitated towards in almost every new language/tool that I try to learn is *Test Driven Development (TDD)*. I have found that in almost all other languages/frameworks that TDD compartmentalises and isolates the code I write for easier testing and debugging, allowing for a slow but steady coding process in the miscellaneous projects I have been working on. In my limited experience of working with C (about 2 years), I have found the tools available for testing my code (I've primarily been using one called [CMocka](https://cmocka.org/)) are lacking at best.\n\nI am hoping that *I* am the problem with this, and that I'm approaching the problem from the wrong perspective. I would say that my primary desired outcome of learning to use C is to be able to write really stable and versatile code that I can use years and years in the future, (and I'm not really concerned with trendy features that other languages use to differentiate themselves from the rest).\n\nAny help, insight, or expertise would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThank you all so much for your suggestions and insights; I have found them all helpful in pointing me in the right direction.\n\nI guess my goal in trying to have TDD in C isn't the actual concept of using TDD, but solving the problem that TDD purports to solve, which is having security that code works as intended before moving on. You have all provided immensely helpful resources for test frameworks, for which I am thankful, and I'm wondering whether it is *necessary* to use a testing framework, or if there is another way to solve the underlying problem, i.e. having a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and reliability of one's code base, allowing the developer to easily identify bugs and bad design patters as early as possible.\n\nIf TDD is indeed necessary, I need the features of the framework to suit me, which would entail all of the following:\n\n* it should be as compatible as possible, which mostly consists of:\n   * being written in C99 or below, and\n   * being platform-independent (any platform that can run CMake should be able to compile it);\n* it has to work with CTest: this is not negotiable;\n* I have to have the source code to it, and should be able to compile the framework with CMake;\n* it should, to quite a large extent, have comprehensive tools for mocking libraries, being able to create mock dll/so files that can be used for test cases (although if this needs to be a separate tool, so be it);\n* the code base should be as readable as is possible, and should also be well documented; and finally,\n* it should be maintained well: if the code used to make sure my other code is working does not work, I'll have created a web of problems.\n\nI know that my requirements are rather specific and pedantic, and I would like to know sooner rather than later if this would require that I create the tool myself, if there isn't a tool that already exists that fulfils all my criteria.\n\nIf, however, TDD is not necessary, and there is a more idiomatically C way that this problem is fixed, I am eager to hear it, as I find mocking in C to be more tedious and laborious than almost all other languages I've used.\n\nThank you again for all the suggestions you've given so far; they've all been pretty helpful in narrowing down the right solution for my use case."

        "content": "Here are my notes after reading the book in one sitting.\n\n**Seduction** *is the act of making a woman equally invested in you*.\n\nBefore sex, men are more invested. This is because women have a biological drive to be picky due to risks: pregnancy, sexual assault, etc. Men have relatively little to lose by sleeping with a partner. Women want sex as much as men, but there are also sociological factors that also come into play.\n\nThere are two ways to make a woman invested in you: Performance (superficial, pick up artist stuff), the second is by being less invested in her (instead become invested in yourself).\n\nManson believes that the best way to attract women is by becoming a \"**low neediness man**\" (which is an indicator of high status). Such a man is in touch with his feelings, has high self-esteem, strong sense of identity, is vulnerable, has self-respect, knows what he values. This is a fundamental aspect of being attractive to women and cannot be faked. \n\nYou want to put women you meet into three categories: **Receptive**, **Neutral**, and **Non-receptive**. Receptive women should be approached and escalated. Neutral women are testing the waters, and you want to \"polarize\" them into either receptive or non-receptive shortly after meeting them. If you wait too long they will move into non-receptive (*the friend zone*). Don't invest anymore time into women who have shown they are non-receptive. Your ultimate goal when meeting women is to Polarize them: make them say \"Fuck Yeah\" or \"Fuck No\".\n\nThe next part of the book is about what he calls the 3 Fundamentals: Honest Living,  Honest Action, and Honest Communication.\n\n# Honest Living\n\nHonest Living is about your lifestyle. Finding what you believe in and creating character. Don’t just go with the flow, don’t just agree, invest in your own interests / passions / desires. Be polarizing and un-inhibited. Make your opinions known, express them. Know why something is interesting to you. Women are attracted to your identity.\n\nThings you can improve:\n\n* Body Language: Make Eye contact, improve your Posture, watch your Vocal Tone when speaking (head vs chest voice), Speed (slow down) nervous needy men speak fast,  Speak Loudly and clearly.\n* Fitness: Exercise and improve your Diet (cut out Sodas, Fast Foods, Desserts, Candy)\n* Fashion: Find fitting clothing, use matching colors, it should match your personality.\n* Demographics: You will experience greater success by pursuing women in areas of your life that you excel at or enjoy. Know what type of women you want to attract. \n\nThere are two types of men who will fail with women:\n\n* Social Anxiety - overthink what others will say, fear of making a move\n* Social Disconnected - wrong actions at the wrong time.\n\nBeliefs. Change your mindset to believe that women want sex just as much as men do. Women need to be comfortable expressing their sexuality around you.\n\n# Honest Action\n\nHonest Action is about overcoming any excuses you might have that prevent you from becoming successful with women.\n\nAnxiety is a sign of neediness, it shows you have a high level of investment in her opinion of you. Keep in mind that rejecting people is awkward, uncomfortable, and not fun for women. Women are generally rooting for you, they want you to succeed. Face your Fears, embrace them. Use incremental and consistent exposure. Focus on: Approaching, Escalating, and using Bold Actions.\n\nAvoid Excuses. The most common are: *Blame Game* \\- Don't blame the woman when you fail. *Apathy / Avoidance* \\- Don't avoid something just because its painful. *Intellectualizing* \\- You can read all you want but actually practicing is worth more.\n\nFapping and Porn. Cut out all Porn, it decreases motivation to pursue women. Jerk off once a week, Pick one Day to Jerk off, but you can only Jerk off to women you have met in person and haven't slept with yet.\n\n# Honest Communication\n\nLearning to express yourself freely and and effectively. How to communicate your true intentions and emotions to others. Men communicate through Facts, Women communicate largely through feelings and emotions. Most men are oblivious to the emotions and intentions that underlie everything women say.\n\nRealize that Women have more to lose than you: They can get pregnant, assaulted, called sluts. Sex is the ultimate act of vulnerability for a woman.\n\n*Tension* \\- create sexual tension with women. *Flirting* is a sexual expression that makes her feel *secure*. Use *Teasing* which creates tension through uncertainty, what did he really mean. Use *Boldness* which create tension by stating clear intentions, you are attracted to her\n\n# a. Emotional Self Awareness and Vulnerability\n\nWomen like vulnerable men, Romance Novels (porn for women) all follow the same pattern: A Hard and Rugged bad boy is troubled but strong. He is fearless but able to open up and share his vulnerable side. They create Emotional Connections with women.\n\nWomen only feel \"slutty\" when sleeping with a man who doesn’t care about her, or who hasn’t connected with her.\n\nBe Vulnerable, and go a level deeper when communicating, Express your Feelings, not facts. Explain why you like something. Use universal emotions such as: ambition, shame, loneliness, achievements, regret, hardship, love, heartbreak.\n\nFlirting: Communicate clearly and effectively. First Impressions matter, they communicate your Intentions, level of anxiety, how you present, how you communicate, and your confidence.\n\n# b. Conversations skills\n\nImprove your conversational skills through the following:\n\n* Effective language, use fewer words, quality over quantity\n* Use statements instead of questions, Statements assume rapport, practice cold reading (making an assumption about her based on her appearance). Avoid blanking during conversations. Statements will make her ask you questions. Use Jumping off points, branch off anything interesting she might share.\n* Use Storytelling, stories always follow a pattern: a Setup, the Conflict and a Resolution.\n* Try to Relate and Connect with women: Open Up. Share your passions / interests, dreams, ambitions, goals. Share your Best / worst experience. Share your childhood experiences, family stories\n* Humor can be expressed in difference ways: Misdirection, Exaggeration, Teasing / Sarcasm, Wordplay, Role Playing.\n\n# The Dating Process\n\nThe Dating Process consist of getting her Phone Number, Talking / Texting , going on Dates, having Sex, and then figuring out the Relationship you want (ONS, FWB, GF).\n\nDon’t obsess over getting phone numbers, be upfront, do not waste time on Flakes, Use texts primary to organize the date.\n\nGeneral tips on planning Dates. Don’t do Lunch dates, they scream friend zone. Plan an Evening or nighttime date (6 pm - 9 pm). No Movie Dates. Avoid Dinner Dates. Select dates that are active, conducive to touching and flirting. Good choices are bowling, drinks, dancing, and walking.\n\nSex. Women are turned on by being wanted, they want to be desired. In General the more you pursue her the more she becomes aroused. Getting physical is key to seduction and dating. Touch her early, touch her often, and make it a necessary habit. You need to make a move: initial touching, first kiss, and then sexual touching. Be Bold, you want your actions to Polarize women. Use a natural progression\n\nSignals. A man's job is to take action, a woman's job is to give signals. There are Pre-approach signals such as eye contact, smiling, closeness. There are Conversation Signals which include smiling, laughing, hair playing, closeness, gazing. And finally there are Escalation Signals, she ditches her friends, she touches you.\n\nKissing. Its always better to try and fail than to wonder. Use your hands, roam her body. Escalate towards sex, touch her breasts. If she lets you its a pretty clear sign she's willing to go further. Women need to be turned on before sex. Last minute objections are common due to social pressures, she wants to shift the blame to you. She doesn't want to feel guilty. Basically continue until she makes you stop\n\nSex. Focus on Foreplay, Teasing, Be dominant, She wants to surrender to you. Talk Dirty, Be Physical. Reassure her if she's insecure about her body.\n\n# Thoughts\n\nOverall I was impressed by the book. I assumed it would be filled with cheesy pick up material but it actually focuses on improving yourself first, becoming a high value (low neediness) man and then gives insight into what techniques work with women."

        "content": "Israeli here, I strongly oppose Netanyahu, but I'll try my best to provide more context here and to explain why this annexation will probably never happen: \n\n1. Literally no one wants it now: since the settler leaders (the ones who will benefit the most  from this) realized that annexation will lead to global recognition in Palestine as a state, which in turn will make additional annexations way more difficult, they publicly withdrew their support and are now actively opposing this move. \n\n2. These settlers are mostly led by religious extremists who want Istael to control all of the Palestinian territories, and Netanyahu announced these annexation plans to try and get their votes in the recent elections. He did - so it won't help him either.\n\n3. Just like the rest of the world, COVID-19 is dragging Israel into a recession. Our unemployment rate is around 20%, and there is massive public anger aimed at the current goverment, which is the largest one we've ever had. Both left and right wing voters oppose this move because of it's economical repercussions. \n\n4. Just like any wannabe-strongman/authoritarian, Netanyahu will NEVER admit he's wrong. The date for annexation has already passed (July 1st), and nothing happenned, but his ministers are still claiming we're going there full speed. They're probably just going to try and sweep it out of the public attention until it dissappears in order to have Netanyahu seem like he \"kept his word\". In a couple of months they'll probably blame the failure on the left. \n\nOne more note - I do not condone anything our current government does or says, and I strongly oppose any act of violence or oppresaion by our military. And I'm not the only one. The majority of Israelis oppose annexation, and about half the population voted AGAINST Netanyahu. Please keep that in mind."

I've worked on video games, compilers, linkers, distributed systems, HPC, desktop application development and more.\n\nFor people interested in such things, I am offering guidance and mentorship. This can be in the form of reveiwing your CV, suggestions for next steps and answer questions from the interviewers perspective.\n\nGiven my experience, if you want to go into web development, I am probably not the right person for you. I am much more suited to those who have an interest in more traditional software development.\n\nAs for how many people I can take on, it all depends on the response I get to this and how much individual attention each person needs. What I can say though is that I'll do my best to respond to you either way!"

        "title": "[D] The machine learning community has a toxicity problem",
        "content": "It is omnipresent!\n\n**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).\n\n**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.\n\n**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name \"neural\" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the \"godfathers\" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.\n\n**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.\n\n**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\n\n**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a \"broader impact\" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).\n\n**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.\n\n**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.\n\nAlbert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. \n\nThe moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. \n\nBest intentions, Yusuf"

        "title": "I've been creating content on LinkedIn for 1.5 years now. This is how I create a year's worth of content plan in a day. (Full guide inside and you can use the strategies for other platforms)",
        "content": "Hello guys,\n\nSocial selling on LinkedIn is not easy.\n\nYou should frequently post to get results.  \nTo post frequently, you should have lots of ideas.  \nTo write those ideas, you need decent writing skills.And so on.\n\nThis guide will teach you how to keep up with all these things. And make it doable by teaching you:  \n\n\n* How to build the right profile type.\n* How to create topic clusters.\n* How to mine platforms for ideas.\n* How to make 30 out of 1 content.\n\nBut you should be consistent. And once you get the rhythm, it'll become natural.\n\nOnwards to the guide.\n\nPS: I'm not using LinkedIn articles. This guide is about regular feed posts on LinkedIn.\n\n# Part one -  Understanding the difference between publisher and library profiles.\n\n**Publisher**\n\n* Posts irregularly.\n* Posts business-related things, memes or funny videos or any content.\n* When you scroll down on the profile, it's a mixed bag.\n\n**Library**\n\n* Post frequently\n* Posts consistently.\n* Speak the language of his or her audience.\n* Narrows down the topics he or she'll talk about. (Picks a niche)\n* Almost always talks about business-related topics.\n* When you scroll down in this profile, it feels like you can find answers to your problems in a specific topic.\n\nIf you want to be a thought leader, you should be a library profile.\n\n# Part two -  Creating topic clusters.\n\nA topic cluster is a group of smaller that are built around one broader topic. See the pic:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/8i3Pxk9](https://imgur.com/a/8i3Pxk9)\n\nBy creating a topic cluster, you'll get rid of this question\n\n\"Okay, what should I post next?\"\n\nHere is an example:\n\n**LinkedIn marketing**\n\n* LinkedIn profile optimization\n* Linkedin content creation\n* LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n* LinkedIn ads\n* LinkedIn growth marketing tools\n* LinkedIn trends in 2020\n* LinkedIn updates\n\nAnd so on. But it doesn’t stop here because every sub-topic has its own sub-topics. Such as:\n\n**Linkedin Sales Navigator**\n\n* How to use Boolean search\n* How to use the feed of sales navigator\n* How to use filters\n* and on and on.\n\nYou can create a map by using any mind mapping app to get a more clear picture.\n\n# Part three - Finding content ideas\n\nI use Reddit <3, LinkedIn, Quora, LinkedIn and FB to find my audience and pick their brains.\n\nOn LinkedIn, you don't have to care about SEO keywords.\n\nIf you can find popular questions, discussion or topics in one of these platforms, you'll more likely get attention.\n\nPopular = Proven.\n\nNow I'll show you how I move around in these platforms. But before that\n\n**A tip to help you write faster on LinkedIn:** Researching without taking notes is just consuming content. I use Evernote to capture the answers, sentences or language people use on these platforms.\n\nThen when I create content, I rephrase their sentences or ideas. In time, it'll make you a better copywriter.\n\n**REDDIT**\n\nYou already know how to use it. Here are quick 5 steps.\n\n* Find your subreddits.\n* Play with filters to find hot topics.\n* Use the search function within subreddit by typing your keywords.\n* Find the best topics to analyze.\n* Always go deep in the comments to find the best ideas. The comment section is a gold mine.\n\n**QUORA**\n\nYou don't have upvotes on Quora. If a topic is popular you can understand it by checking three things:\n\n* Followers. The more followers a question has, the more views it gets.\n* Stats. By viewing stats and log you can see the stats of question. (Hit the three-dot to find it out)\n* Answers.  The more answers a question has, the more popular it is.\n\nHere instead of Subreddits, you have Spaces. They're the same thing.\n\nAgain you'll pick keywords from your topic cluster and search popular answers, check comments and so on.\n\n**Little known trick:**\n\n1. Go to ads manager\n2. Create an ad\n3. Fill the first screen and proceed (don't worry you'll not spend any money)\n4. From targeting section pick this [https://imgur.com/a/9E87oZ2](https://imgur.com/a/9E87oZ2)\n5. Click bulk add and enter your keywords\n6. Quora will share the most popular topics with you [https://imgur.com/a/F9tPmLe](https://imgur.com/a/F9tPmLe)\n\n**LINKEDIN**\n\nGo to search, click the content section in the search and enter your keyword.\n\nPlay with the filters and see what content works best on LinkedIn.\n\n**FB**\n\nFind and join the related FB communities and monitor the topics in the group. You can use filters and group search to see popular posts.\n\n# Part four - No content is limited to single-use.\n\nThis is important and I'll say it again.\n\n**No content is limited to single-use.**\n\nLet's say you have a comprehensive blog post or long format content.\n\nYou can squeeze it and extract tons of content out of it. How?\n\n* Make a carousel (slider) content that sums up your blog post\n* Divide it into five parts and write a long-form post on LinkedIn \n* Part 1\n* Part 2\n* Part 3\n* Part 4\n* Part 5\n* Shoot the video of the blog post\n* Write a bit more about it and transform it into a lead magnet\n* Create an infographic out of it. It doesn’t have to be limited to pie charts. You can sum up key takeaways, as we do in this eBook\n\nYou have raw footage of video from an interview or seminar or workshop.\n\n* Extract fun, informative and interesting moments then create 1-3 minute LinkedIn posts\n* Repurpose them into 15-30-45-60 sec videos\n* Write a long-form LinkedIn content about your experience\n* Create slides out of it\n* Write five key takeaways posts\n* Make gifs out of the raw footage\n* Go even smaller and capture some photographs from the footage and write about it\n* And many many more\n\nYou see what I am doing here? I tear down huge content pieces until I have nothing in my hands.\n\nHere is how my content pyramid looks like  (I interpreted Gary Vee's content deck for my needs)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FMwJhMO](https://imgur.com/a/FMwJhMO)\n\nBy creating this system, you could make 30 out of 1 content.\n\n# ------\n\nThat's all folks. Thanks for following until the end.\n\nI hope you learned something new. I've also written a post about how to write content for maximum engagement on Reddit.

        "content": "I’ve been waiting a long time to be able to write this post. I’ve seen others achieve this same accomplishment and that was a huge part of my motivation. \n\nWent from six figure + year job - to just leaving and hoping to find a web dev role. Two big factors currently were corona and I moved to a new city. So the cards were stacked against me but determination and consistency won. \n\nMy self taught course:\nStudied elementary OOP and Java about 4 years ago while working full time. Built some small apps here and there and then let it go for a while. Focused real hard on my day job until 1 year ago when I know I had an upcoming move for other reasons. \n\nI decided to go heavily into web dev and used freecodecamp as my foundation. The site was very useful and gave me a great intro to web dev. I didn’t fully complete each section and all challenges. Tbh I didn’t complete most of the projects. I just made sure I knew the concepts. By the time I got to the data visualization module, I decide to put FCC to the side and build my own react project. \n\nThis is where the magic happened and I encourage all who want to get into development to do the same. Building your first project from complete scratch with no tutorial will teach you more than any camp or course. From downloading you IDE to setting up file structure to running create-react-app on the command line - everything was new to me but I literally Googled everything. Any question I had I just googled it and girded through it. It was slow and painful but you need to get through this learning curve. Just learning standard file structure for a full stack app was never taught anywhere. I found these from reading Stack Overflow, github, FCC forums etc. \n\nFirst project took about 2 months - simple text generation app deployed on Heroku and did this all after hours while working 50 hours a week. \n\nI would like to note also, I was heavily sending commits to github (another thing I had to google / YT to learn) to build up my profile to show employers. \n\nOnce complete it took my project that I was super happy with and started applying to jobs! Turns out, employers won’t hire you based off a text generator app. After 1 month of rejections and about 70 apps I went back to the drawing board and decided to build another app. A messaging application with React. \n\nHaving more knowledge this time around was much easier and I completed a fairly ugly messaging app in about a month using Talk.js. \n\nAgain I took this around and started applying.. nothing. Crickets. Back to the drawing board. Instead of building a new app, I decided to make this into a full stack project using Express and Mongo. The MERN stack. I taught my self about the backend, APIs, databases etc. This was my turning point. \n\nBy this time I felt I knew enough to be deadly but my resume was still lacking professional expirence. I did away with the cover letter and the fact that I was passionately self teaching myself at night. I learned quickly employers don’t care about that. I made it look professional, removed most of my prior jobs and listed the projects I built, was working on and my github account. \n\nI started to get reply’s! I also totally rearranged my LinkedIn.. making it mirror my resume and listing myself as looking for employment as a full stack dev. The recruiters flowed in. \n\nIn my experience - I came across one recruiter who really helped my up my resume. All the other were a waste of time. What I did was begin messaging companies directly. Going to their site, find the Contact Us form and send them a message. “Hey, I’m a full stack dev looking for a great team to work with. Was wondering if you had any upcoming roles. Would love to talk” short and sweet. \n\nEventually I found an awesome company that was happy to have me onboard. I’m now beginning my development career. They’re fully aware of the self taught aspect. \n\nMy advice is think of the goal as having two prongs: the hands on coding and the job search. Invest time in both equally however make sure your dev skills are up to par first. \n\nApplication submitted: 150\nRecruiter calls that lead nowhere: 40\nInterviews: 10\nOffers: 1\n\nTotal time spent developing since Nov 2019: ~400 if I had to put a number on it"

How can any politician be held accountable internationally if basically every crime they commit is politically motivated?  And isn't terrorism *by definition* a political act?  If taken to it's full logical conclusion, Interpol is useless because someone could argue that any arrest of a government official is political \"activity\" because politics are *inherent* in literally all international affairs.  Even arresting the Money Heist gang would be political in nature when considering WHY the state found it so damned important."

Yeah, you do need to know a bit *all of those things* to be a good analyst. But a core principal of organization security is called *separation of duties.* Expecting one person to do it all is not only bad security practice, it's just flat out *bad.* The burnout and the expectation to know how to do all of these things is ridiculous. I can say whether or not the bubble network is secure, I can work with the neteng guys to make sure access goes to the people it needs to, that if we have a 2FA solution it's implemented properly, etc....but I should *not* be the one asked to deploy these solutions, patch them, back them up, and play helpdesk whenever someone's 2FA is shitting itself. That is a *not* the role of a security analyst, but for some reason companies here think it is.\n\n5 years ago entry level work was around like $70k/year in my area with the only certs they were looking for being a security plus. Now they want a CISSP minimum, some variation of SANS cert, and they want you to have a home lab, active engagement in all hacker communities, etc. It's fucking exhausting. I just want to show up to work, do my job, and go home like literally any other white collar industry. Why I am expected to constantly be working on improving shit for work outside of work is insane and ultimate why I left cybersecurity after being in it for 3 years. And I'm not talking about keeping up-to-date on threat intel and security advisory reports. That's whatever. I'm talking about employers who frown when you tell them you don't spend your downtime talking about, thinking about, jerking off to hacking and vulnerability assessments. Sorry, I am a human being who likes to do hobbies that *aren't* my job and why this isn't accepted in the security industry is absolutely infuriating."

        "content": "#### Edit: Please read to avoid confusion:  \n\nI'm getting together the data now and enlisted the help of my colleagues who were also involved in the RE process. We'll be publishing data here over the next few days: https://www.reddit.com/r/tiktok_reversing/. I invite any security folk who have the time to post what they've got as well - known domains and ip addresses for sysadmins to filter on, etc. I understand the app has changed quite a bit in recent versions, so my data won't be up to date.\n\n\n\nI understand there's a lot of attention on this post right now, but please be patient.\n\n---  \n\n\nSo I can personally weigh in on this. I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.  \n\n- Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)  \n- Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)  \n- Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)  \n- Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken  \n- Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC  \n- They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication  \n\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n\nOn top of all of the above, they weren't even using HTTPS for the longest time. They leaked users' email addresses in their HTTP REST API, as well as their secondary emails used for password resets. Don't forget about users' real names and birthdays, too. It was allllll publicly viewable a few months ago if you MITM'd the application.\n\n\nThey provide users with a taste of \"virality\" to entice them to stay on the platform. Your first TikTok post will likely garner quite a bit of likes, regardless of how good it is.. assuming you get past the initial moderation queue if thats still a thing. Most users end up chasing the dragon. Oh, there's also a ton of creepy old men who have direct access to children on the app, and I've personally seen (and reported) some really suspect stuff. 40-50 year old men getting 8-10 year old girls to do \"duets\" with them with sexually suggestive songs. Those videos are posted publicly. TikTok has direct messaging functionality.\n\n\nHere's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing. They also made it so you cannot use the app at all if you block communication to their analytics host off at the DNS-level.\n\n\nFor what it's worth I've reversed the Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter apps. They don't collect anywhere near the same amount of data that TikTok does, and they sure as hell aren't outright trying to hide exactly whats being sent like TikTok is. It's like comparing a cup of water to the ocean - they just don't compare.\n\n\n\n### tl;dr; I'm a nerd who figures out how apps work for a job. Calling it an advertising platform is an understatement. TikTok is essentially malware that is targeting children. Don't use TikTok. Don't let your friends and family use it.\n\n---  \n\nEdit: Well this blew up - sorry for the typos, I wrote this comment pretty quick. I appreciate the gold/rewards/etc people, but I'm honestly just glad I'm finally able to put this information in front of people (even if it may outdated by a few months).\n\n\nIf you're a security researcher and want to take a look at the most recent versions of the app, send me a PM and I'll give you all of the information I have as a jumping point for you to do your thing.\n\n---  \n\n\n### Edit 2: More research..\n\n/u/kisuka left the following comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/fxgi06/not_new_news_but_tbh_if_you_have_tiktiok_just_get/fn1e2e3/):\n\n> Piggy-backing on this. Penetrum just put out their TikTok research: https://penetrum.com/research/tiktok/\n\n## Edit 2: Damn people. You necromanced the hell out of this comment. \n## Edit 3: Updated the Penetrum link + added Zimperium's report (requires you request it manually)\n\nThe above Penetrum link appears to be gone. Someone else linked the paper here: https://penetrum.com/research\n\nZimperium put out a report awhile ago too: https://blog.zimperium.com/zimperium-analyzes-tiktoks-security-and-privacy-risks/   \n\n### Edit 4: Messages  \n\nSo this post blew up for the third time. I've responded to over 200 replies and messages in the last 24 hours, but haven't gotten to the 80 or so DM's via the chat app. I intend on getting to them soon, though. I'm going to be throwing together a blog or something very soon and publishing some info. I'll update this post as soon as I have it up."

I know the super basics of HTML/CSS, how would you for the lack of a better word, \"connect\" the application I built with a webpage/UI so a user can use it without the terminal?  The only things I'm comfortable with is C++, basic HTML/CSS, so I'm open to learning new stuff to achieve this.\n\nAdditional question: is what I built considered the back-end?\n\n**Edit:**  I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to respond to my thread, even though my question wasn't clear, you guys did an amazing job of giving me things to look into and explaining the basics of it to a new learner (even though I've never heard of some of the technologies listed, it's a starting point).  Just to clarify, I was looking to build a web app instead of an app on the computer, but now I'm kind of interested in doing both.  My next step is to learn javascript and go from there."

So sometimes this means positions will cancel or weights will change or cancel each other out from original alpha model signals for the final trade signal\n\n3- execution. Trade signals get sent to the execution model which will actually execute trades. \n\nIn terms of literature on it, there really isn’t a whole lot and ultimately works with trial and error. Our desk works really fast so we don’t have time for a while lot of optimisation and fancy modelling pre-trade so in essence it’ll be pretty general rules and ensuring certain signals aren’t crossing each other (don’t want to send a buy and a sell order for the same asset at the same time) and a semi manual signal weighting system which will prioritise certain (more reliable) models."

        "content": "A few good background readings are [this by Woodford](http://www.columbia.edu/~mw2230/Convergence_AEJ.pdf) and [this by Kocherlakota.](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/SomeThoughtsOnStateOfMacro.Kocherlakota2009.pdf)\n\nSome things that, I think, are pretty well attested:\n\n1. In the long run, economic growth comes through increased labor productivity and technological change, not through the accumulation of factors of production. See Easterly and Levine, \"It's Not Factor Accumulation,\" 2000.\n\n2. The basic Solow growth model can, nevertheless, form the useful core of a theory of growth. See Mankiw, Romer, and Weil, \"A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth,\" 1992.\n\n3. In the long run, the price level is directly proportional to the level of the money stock. The inflation rate is proportional to the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, \"Monetary Neutrality,\" 1995. (This is the *quantity theory of money.*)\n\n4. In the long run, the level of output is independent of the money stock. The growth rate of output is independent of the growth rate of the money stock. See Lucas, \"Monetary Neutrality,\" 1995. (This is the *neutrality of money.*)\n\n5. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon (see 3), so monetary policy may be usefully tasked with the responsibility of keeping inflation stable.\n\n5. In the short run, monetary policy can affect *both* output growth *and* inflation. This is the Phillips Curve relationship. See Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, \"Monetary Policy Shocks,\" 1999.\n\n6. Monetary policy takes some time to affect broader macroeconomic aggregates. Hence the central bank should not target *current* inflation, but inflation *over some medium-term horizon,* typically 2-5 years. See Svensson, \"Inflation Forecast Targeting,\" 1997.\n\n7. Stabilization policy can usefully mitigate business-cycle fluctuations. See Friedman, \"The Role of Monetary Policy, 1968. See Eichenbaum, \"Some Thoughts on Practical Stabilization Policy,\" 1998. See Svensson, \"What have we learned in the past 50 years,\" 2008.\n\n8. Monetary and fiscal policymaking should be analyzed as \"rules,\" not as year-by-year decisions about the interest rate or deficit. Policy should be systematic, predictable, and lean against macroeconomic fluctuations. See Kydland and Prescott, \"Rules rather than Discretion,\" 1977. \n\n8. Macroeconomic policy is affected by the way the private sector *perceives* policy. Statistical correlations can break down as soon as policymakers try to exploit them. See Lucas, \"Expectations and the Neutrality of Money,\" 1972. See Lucas, \"Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique,\" 1976.\n\n9. If monetary policy is stabilizing the business cycle, there is little role for countercyclical fiscal policy. See Auerbach, \"Is there a role for discretionary fiscal policy,\" ‎2002. See Taylor, \"Reassessing Discretionary Fiscal Policy,\" 2000. Fiscal policy should focus on public finance issues: public goods provision, social insurance provision, reasonable taxation, and reasonable regulation practices. Leave countercyclical policy to the central bank.\n\n9. Monetary expansion is expansionary; fiscal contraction is contractionary. See [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/32z2hr/bad_economic_discussion_thread_17_april_2015/cqgljzk)\n\n10. In the long run, exchange rates reflect puchasing power parity. In the short run, we have no idea what drives exchange rate fluctuations. See Rogoff, \"The PPP Puzzle,\" JEL 1996.\n\nMaybe some of those are uninteresting to you, but they are a start. I'll add more if you want."

        "title": "N'ayez aucunes pitié pour les grandes enseignes multimédia de proximité.",
        "content": "Bonsoir mes amis de air France. Petit topic de la soirée pour vous rassurer ou vous informer du concept moderne des grands vendeurs français de multimédia. Ici on parle de Fnac, Darty, Boulanger et compagnie.   \n\n\nJ'entend pas mal de connaissances dire que Amazon c'est le mal et que ça fait crever nos belles entreprises françaises. C'est vrai. Cependant il ne faut pas forcement les pleurer.  \n\n\nJe m’explique. J'ai travailler chez Fnac et Darty. Je précise que je suis rentré dans ces entreprises avec un diplôme de technicien avec l'envie de renseigner mes clients et de les conduire vers un achat qui leur convient le mieux possible.  \n\n\nSi vous pensez qu'en allant a la Fnac ou chez Darty et compagnie vous trouverez un conseil avisé et des vendeurs aux petits soins, oubliez de suite.   \n\n\nOn m'a très vite fait comprendre dans les 2 entreprises que j’expliquais trop de choses au clients. Que je prenais trop de temps a leur trouver un produit et SURTOUT , que je n’étais pas assez bon pour vendre des garanties.   \n\n\nParce que oui. Le vendeur de ces enseignes ne souhaite en aucuns cas vous proposer un produit adapté. Il faut d'ailleurs savoir que 90% des vendeurs n'y connaisse absolument RIEN en multimédia. L'unique buts des \"bons\" vendeurs est de vous vendre la garantie ou autres services. Par bon , j'entend vendeur qui se fait une bonne paye.   \n\n\nFace à Amazon qui a choisi la quantité pour faire du chiffre, nos chers enseignes n'ont pas choisi la qualité. Oh que non mes amis. Ils ont choisi l'arnaque ou la vente forcée. Quelle tristesse.   \n\n\nSachez que vous ne trouverez que très rarement des bons conseils dans ces magasins. Les vendeurs sont quasi tous issu d'une formation commerciale avec 0 connaissances techniques. Vous en savez déjà surement plus qu'eux sur le produit qui vous intéresse. Ils seront cependant surement assez bon pour vous forcer a prendre une garantie absolument pas rentable si on fait un ratio prix/risque de panne  \n\n\nIl est également à savoir que le salaire d'un vendeur multimédia est directement lié aux nombre de services/produits en fin de vie/produits de démonstration que le dit vendeur arrive a refourguer.   \n\n\nJe trouve ça vraiment désolant. il n'existe plus ou presque plus de magasins en France qui arrive a proposer des produits a prix acceptable avec un vendeur qui puisse renseigner sans harceler son client.  \n\n\nVous allez dire que je suis salé et que je cherche a régler mes comptes et vous aurez absolument raison. Mais je tenais tout de même a vous faire connaitre la réalité des choses pour les personnes qui ne serait pas encore au courant.  \n\n\nLa vrai question est donc : Comment on fait ?  Et bien si vous êtes prêt a mettre un peu plus que le prix sur amazon , achetez dans les petits magasin ou vous aurez beaucoup plus de chance d'avoir un vrai conseil. Sinon renseignez vous sur internet , et achetez sur Amazon. C'est con , c'est désolant , mais c'est le monde actuel."

It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag.

It's likely more embarrassing than criminal but at this point the refusal to release the report is becoming the story - similarly to Trump's tax returns I guess.\n\nThe current UK government is a nationalist, ideology driven mess highly akin to the Trump movement. The party purged a substantial number of their more moderate membership and attempted to remove the UK parliament from equal footing with the executive and turn it into a lower chamber with no mandate to do so from the electorate.\n\nThey now have a massive majority, around 5 versions of Fox News gifting them widespread support and the country is on it's knees with a botched covid response.

The purpose of this is to provide quick identification of things, such as prey or a predator.\n\nThe second mechanism is the tracking mechanism. Once your brain has locked onto something it wants to follow it then switches to making sure you can track that thing very carefully. This is useful for things like throwing spears, catching a ball, or anything else which requires you to intercept a moving target.\n\nThe third mechanism is a stabilization mechanism. Lock your eyes on a specific place and then move your head around. Whether you move your head up and down or left to right you can keep your eyes locked on that specific spot.\n\nEdit: Apparently I need to be more specific. Only one mechanism can be active at a time. So if you aren't tracking you aren't going to get smooth movement. Those are just the mechanisms our eyes have developed with. \n\nIf you want something a lot more indepth than that, you're gonna need to talk to a specialist and it's sure not going to be ELI5. Might as well ask why there are two different primary muscle types (slow vs quick) and why we can't selectively turn them off and on."

I realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online, but many are either overly complex, oversimplified, trying to sell you some products, etc. I figured I would explain some of it here, in order to reduce the learning barrier. After all, knowledge is power. And given the **recent** [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss) **with Robinhood**, I figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood, and don’t end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later. If you are interested in trading options, I invite you to look for more details online.\n\nI have been trading options since 2008. I made some mistakes, so many, especially in the beginning. Over the years, I kinda reduced my option trading activities, but these past few months, I have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile, which helps with my trading style.\n\nThis **first** post is to explain how options work in general, the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will go into some more details, the third posts [3a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/) and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/) will explain some standard strategies, and the fourth posts ([4a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/) and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how I approach option investing. If you are looking at r/wsb style of investment, please skip these posts, they are not for you. I am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles, but I will still take some calculated risks. So I say. :) It is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard ETFs / mutual funds / Real Estate. So, my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth.\n\nIt is often perceived that options are extremely risky, and one of the best ways to get ruined. For some trades, this can be true. To dispel a myth, in reality, options can also be used to be extremely conservative. Even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market. Unlike for shares, where you can only control the diversification, with options you have a much bigger control on the risk / profit profile. Time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit (or lose) from.\n\nOne thing to note is that not all companies or ETFs provide options for their shares.\n\n**The basics: CALL and PUT contracts, strike, and exercise**\n\nOptions are split into two groups: CALLs and PUTs. Both have a strike, an expiration date, and a number of shares attached to it. We’ll talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later. When you buy a call or put option, you buy a contract with a 3rd party through your broker and the stock market. Usually, one contract represents 100 shares.\n\nThe strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument. So for SPY that is worth $308 today, you will have options with strike $308, but also $300, $301, $310, etc… From $5 to $525. Options strikes are created as the underlying instrument SPY goes up and down. For SPY, strikes have a granularity of $1 around the share price, but can also be $5 or even $10 farther from the current price. Some other instruments have a $2.5, $5 or even $10 granularity. It can even have a $0.50 granularity. (Hello Hertz! It dropped so much that the lowest strike is $0.50 right now).\n\nA CALL is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you buy a call with a $150 strike, and the share price went up to reach $200, this allows you to buy some shares at $150 that are now worth $200. The action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call. When you exercise your call contract, you are buying shares into your account.\n\nRemember that, in most cases, 1 contract will buy 100 shares in your account. When exercising each call contract, you will need $15k of cash in your account in this example ($150 for the strike, multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $20k (at $200 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the call option (more on this later), this means you will make a profit of $5k if you sell the shares.\n\nConversely, a PUT is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you bought a put with a $200 strike, and the share price went down to $150, this allows you to sell some shares at $200 that are now worth $150 each. Similarly to a call, the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put.\n\nWhen exercising each put contract, you are selling 100 shares from your account. When exercising each contract, your 100 shares will be sold for $20k ($200 for the strike multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $15k (at $150 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the put option, this means you made a profit of $5k. If you did not have the 100 shares per contract in your account, you would be actually short selling the shares, and you could make the $5k profit by buying these shares back.\n\nIn summary, a call buys shares when exercising. A put sells shares when exercising. Most importantly, in the vast majority of the cases, you should actually not exercise your contracts, but instead, you should sell your call or put at the market price, as you will increase your profit (see extrinsic value later).\n\nBrokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money. In other words, you can’t exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call (you want to buy low when the value is high), or current value is above the strike for a put (you want to sell high when the value is low).\n\nMost brokers do auto-exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised. If the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date, and you did not sell your contracts before, they will be worthless, and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost.\n\nAlthough I am mostly talking about American style options that can be exercised at any time, there are also European style options that can only be exercised at expiration. In the US markets, pretty much all stocks and ETFs are American style, But the cash-settled indexes, like SPX and RUT, are European style.\n\n**The basics: Intrinsic and extrinsic value**\n\nA call or a put contract costs money to buy, called a premium, so a 3rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put. After all, they won’t take the other side of this contract for free, and they have to be remunerated. The minimum for a contract is $0.01 per share for some very liquid ETFs, but for most instruments, it is $0.05, thus $5 per contract for 100 shares. When you buy a call or put, this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date. The 3rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses (see below).\n\nThe value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike, on the share price going up and down, the share’s volatility (how fast / far it goes up or down), and the time passing.\n\nWhen you buy a contract, the strike and the expiration date is known. However, the share price and volatility will constantly change. All the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing (closer to the expiration date).\n\nThe intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price. It is above $0 only when you can exercise the contract. The extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time. For pretty much all options, this extrinsic value is above $0, and will slowly drop to $0 as we get closer to the expiration.\n\nLet’s take an example with a share price of $150.\n\nSay, you buy a call with a strike of $145 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($150 - $145), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5). Said differently, if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date, your call contract would bring you $5 per share. You would have lost $2 due to the time passing.\n\nSimilarly, you buy a put with a strike of $155 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($155 - $150), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5).\n\nIt is worth noting that any call with a strike price at $150 or above has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $155 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. If the stock price does not go over $155, you will lose the full $4 per share (so a $400 loss per contract). Similarly, a put with a strike price at $150 or below has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $145 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. Your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under $145.\n\nNote that, in these examples, I use the same price for the call and put options that are $5 away from the strike price, but it’s not always the case. The call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility, market expectations, potential dividends, cost of money, etc.\n\n**The basics: ATM, ITM, and OTM**\n\nThere are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls.\n\nAn option is ‘At The Money’ (ATM) when the current share value is matching the strike. The share price is $150, and the strike of $150 for both the call and put contracts will be considered ‘at the money’.\n\nAn option is ‘In The Money’ (ITM) when the contract has some intrinsic value. The share price is $150, so a call at $140 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value. A put at $160 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value too.\n\nAn option is ‘deep in the money’ when the option is ITM and the strike is far from the current share price (for example more than 20%). For example, with a share price of $150, a $100 call will be considered ‘deep in the money’. Same for a $200 put.\n\nConversely, an option is ‘out of the money’ if there is no intrinsic value. With a $150 share price, a $160 call is ‘out of the money’. A $140 put is ‘out of the money’. The money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value, there is no intrinsic value. An option is ‘deep out of the money’ when the option is OTM and the strike is far from the current share price. For example, with a share price of $150, a $200 call will be considered ‘deep out of the money’. Same for a $100 put.\n\nAs the share price goes up and down, depending on the option strikes, it can switch between ITM, to ATM, to OTM. The option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility.\n\nFew key things to note:\n\n* The deeper ITM an option is, the more expensive it is. As it gets deeper ITM, the intrinsic value increases, the extrinsic value decreases. You have a higher chance for the option to be worth something, and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value. The price of Deep ITM options will move very closely to the underlying shares (a positive correlation for calls, a negative correlation for puts).\n* The deeper OTM an option is, the less expensive it is. Again, OTM option price is pure extrinsic value. You have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration.\n* The maximum extrinsic value is when the option is ATM. It is purely extrinsic value, with barely any intrinsic value. These option strikes are the most sensitive to time, volatility and share price.\n\nHere is an example, with the same share price of $150. For a call, you could get something like this:\n\nStrike = $100 / Premium = $53 / Intrinsic = $50 / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep ITM\n\nStrike = $125 / Premium = $30 / Intrinsic = $25 / Extrinsic = $5 ← ITM\n\nStrike = $150 / Premium = $9   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $9 ← ATM\n\nStrike = $175 / Premium = $5   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $5 ← OTM\n\nStrike = $200 / Premium = $3   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep OTM\n\nYou can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction.\n\nIt is worth noting that if you have a $100 call and you decide to exercise it, you would directly get $50 of proceeds per share, but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to $0, losing $3 of proceeds. Instead of exercising your call, you are much better off selling your call for $53. In general, there are not many reasons to exercise your options. Selling them is more advantageous.\n\nThe [next](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will continue talking about the basics of options.\n\n`---`\n\n**Post 1: Basics: CALL, PUT, exercise, ITM, ATM, OTM**\n\n[Post 2: Basics: Buying and Selling, the greeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/)\n\n[Post 3a: Simple Strategies](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/)\n\n[Post 3b: Advanced Strategies](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/)\n\n[Post 4a: Example of trades (short puts, covered calls, and verticals)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/)\n\n[Post 4b: Example of trades (calendars and hedges)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)"

        "content": "In longboarding you have 3 ways of braking. The main technique is a slide, in which you push the back end of the board out so the wheels are now diagonally on the road. You loose speed from the resistance of the wheels on the road, and at the same time the road scraps the plastic off your wheels. Do it often and long enough, and your wheels are gone. Slide can be done standing up, or in a crouched position with one hand on the road. This is what the puck on the gloves is for, to keep you stable and your feet firmly on the board, while the rest of your body is leaning above the road. The puck is designed to give as few resistance as possible while not wearing down too quick. If it actually braked your speed, the tension would pull you off your board. The glove also helps you go through to tight corners by allowing you lean further off your board.\n\nSecond way is by air-braking, which you see the girls do from time to time. Standing up increases your area of wind resistance and can help you slow down somewhere between 10 to 20kmph depending on your initial speed, your size and the wind itself. This is generally done just before a corner, and just before getting into a slide. It's not used as a way to come to a stop, because that is not possible with air-braking.\n\nA third way is to foot-brake. Which is simply putting one foot on the ground and braking on the resistance of the sole of your shoe on the asphalt. At higher speeds this will heat up and destroy your shoe very quickly, and also be very unstable due to only standing on one foot on your board. You cannot put your whole weight on the foot on the asphalt, because that would instantly pull you off the board yourself.\n\nLongboards are designed to allow for much higher speeds than street skateboards. The trucks are different, called Reverse Kingpin Trucks. Their design makes them turn smoother and more stable at higher speeds. In essence speed wobble is the magnification of tiny adjustments due to high speed, often ending up becoming uncontrollable and having the ride wipe out. Often caused by not putting enough pressure on the front truck, which causes the truck to adjust to every little bump and crack in the road. Putting enough weight on the front truck allows the rider to keep control of the truck and not get speed wobbles. I think the current speed record is around 130kmpu atm. \n\nThe girls in this video are Jasmijn & Lisa from The Netherlands & Belgium btw.  \n\n\nI hope this was informative :)"

        "content": "Learning and retaining information is all about building neural connections and pathways in the brain.\n\nWe learn most small new things through association, others through visualisation, and concepts such as the stuff you’re likely to encounter in books more through application or teaching the same concepts. \n\nAssociation learning concerns learning a new persons name. We might associate that name with something else and recall that information quicker the next time we see them. We may even create a funny nickname for them, helping us to remember. \n\nVisualisation helps us remember things like sequences, what a combination looks like, what sequence do we do things in (visualise brushing your teeth in the morning), or learning directions - turn left at the gas station (visualising a gas station). \n\nConceptual learning is a little more difficult. To grasp a concept takes time and understanding. Teaching and discussing the concept is a sure fire way to remember it. Applying the knowledge and learning through application (seeing is believing) is the best way.\n\nIf you can discern the difference in which new information is which in your daily life and apply these techniques, it will go a long way to helping you retain."

People respond well to confidence (not arrogance, though). For example, you could just say,  \"I like you, and I'm attracted to you. If that makes you uncomfortable, just tell me, and I won't bring it up again.\" And then give them a nice, sincere smile. And smile when they give you their answer. If they return your feelings, you can just tell them that it makes you happy. If they say they don't feel that way about you, just tell them that it was worth the shot and you hope they find the right person. Then change the subject and go back to friend mode. \n\nThe number one way to move past a rejection fear is to put yourself in situations where you can be rejected. In behavior therapy, that's called systematic desensitization. I think after being rejected a few times, you realize it's not as bad as you feared. Rejection isn't necessarily about your inherent worth; it's about whether or not someone else sees you as a good fit. So put yourself out there and see what happens! Best case scenario, you meet the love of your life, and worst case scenario, you walk away the same way you came in. You can't lose what you don't have."

        "content": "So this article is specifically talking about the South China Sea.\n\nThere's an interesting international legal reason that this constantly happens in the South China Sea. Basically, in order to prevent China from taking sovereignty over the islands, the United States and other states that do not want China to have legal claim to the islands, must display that China does not have that sovereignty.\n\nChina is attempting to declare a bunch of islands within the South China Sea to be its own territory, most people know this. The reason is the vast natural resource bed available as well as a geopolitically advantageous position. In order to do so it has made its own islands and occupied them which does not actually give them any rights over the surrounding waters according to the Law of the Sea Convention. However, it is also occupying natural islands in the area as well.\n\nAccording to the *Island of Palmas Case* (Netherlands v. United States) (1928), 2 RIAA 829, a state effectively occupies a territory when it is able to exert sovereignty over that territory, which in effect, actually leads to that sovereignty. Here is the major except from the case from page 839 of volume II of the UN report of international arbitration awards from 1928.\n\n> Titles of acquisition of territorial sovereignty in present-day international law are either based on an act of effective apprehension, such as occupation or conquest, or, like cession, presuppose that the ceding and the cessionary Powers or at least one of them, have the faculty of effectively disposing of the ceded territory. In the same way natural accretion can only be conceived of as an accretion to a portion of territory where there exists an actual sovereignty capable of extending to a spot which falls within its sphere of activity. It seems therefore natural that an element which is essential for the constitution of sovereignty should not be lacking in its continuation. So true is this, that practice, as well as doctrine, recognizes—though under different legal formulae and with certain differences as to the conditions required—that the continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty (peaceful in relation to other States) is as good as a title. The growing insistence with which international law, ever since the middle of the 18th century, has demanded that the occupation shall be effective would be inconceivable, if effectiveness were required only for the act of acquisition and not equally for the maintenance of the right. If the effectiveness has above all been insisted on in regard to occupation, this is because the question rarely arises in connection with territories in which there is already an established order of things. Just as before the rise of international law, boundaries of lands were necessarily determined by the fact that the power of a State was exercised within them, so too, under the reign of international law., the fact of peaceful and continuous display is still one of the most important considerations in establishing boundaries between States.\n\nWhat this leads to is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaKbZW0pqkM\n\nWhich happens at least every few months. China asserts its sovereignty, the United States in calling it international airspace disputes that sovereignty. Every time a country successfully sails its ships through the area without China preventing that freedom of movement through international waters, its claim to the islands is weakened. So, when the US attempts to sail its ships through the areas that China is claiming sovereignty to, it responds as if it actually has sovereignty over the area.\n\n\n**The reason this time it is significant**, is because three carrier groups are far in excess of what was previously considered necessary to fight the claim that China owns the territory. From an international legal perspective this may mean two things. First, that the United States is simply being defensive and signalling its might by sailing near the sea but not through it largely for geopolitical reasons, or second, that the United States is genuinely concerned that China's land claims in the South China Sea are actually becoming effective, and therefore feel that the necessary threshold to show that the land claims in the South China Sea are *not* legal is now higher. If the latter is the case, we can expect more behaviour like this for the foreseeable future until China backs off of its land claims, or the United States and NATO allies decide persistent objection to the claims with this type of persistent show of force is not worth the effort.\n\n\n**Edit:** This source is heavily biased in its commentary. That said, the United States is actually doing this, and you can read more from better sources in the following links:\n\nhttps://time.com/5852710/u-s-aircraft-carriers-indo-pacific-china/\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sends-aircraft-carriers-as-china-makes-waves-in-the-pacific-11591780654\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/3-navy-carriers-in-pacific-seen-as-warning-to-china-2020-6\n\n\n\n**Edit 2** I've really gotta go to bed, but thanks for all of the really solid law questions! You can keep asking and I'll try and get to them tomorrow. The most complex questions will take a bit more time for the proper sources to make sure I'm giving the right information, but I'll try and get through the ones I know enough to answer all the same!

There isn’t a secret book that says, “Run these super secret commands and swear a blood oath that you’ll never tell another soul about them”. It’s just that until you start analyzing your target, you really don’t know the specifics of what you’ll need to do to compromise it.\n\nEdit: All of that being said, there are plenty of resources available on just about every tool and technique you will ever use, but a big part of hacking is knowing when to use them.

For example, you could switch to a modern front-end framework (React/Angular/Vue etc) and tweak your back end to just serve up data, which would allow you to improve UX (User Experience).  However, this is a fair bit of a rewrite given what you currently have.  If web development is an area you are interested in exploring in greater detai,l it might be worth looking at those frameworks, or equivilants, for your next project.\n\nAs you are dealing with emails - and by extension personal data - you should probably look at tightening up your security.  The current popular trend is the usage of OAuth 2.0 and I strongly encourage you to investigate how to roll it into your current system rather than using what I believe is your own coded solution.  As you're using PHP this should help get you started: [https://oauth.net/code/php/](https://oauth.net/code/php/) (I personally have not implemented an OAuth 2.0 flow into PHP so if another user has, and is willing to chip in, then please go ahead!)\n\nI spotted a few bugs, which you may or may not be aware of, which I have detailed below.  You may wish to address these reasonably soon, as they may impair adoption rates.\n\nBugs\n\n* Emails\n   * The email is \"from\" your AWS SMTP (a particularly ugly and suspicious looking address), so you should look to link it to your DNS for TokyDoky.com\n   * Thank \"you, TokyDoky\" is wrapped in the same hyperlink as the confirmation link. Not industry standard practice.\n* Events\n   * After creating an event a banner appears at the top of the page detailing the global event count for the entire website.  Possibly debug functionality left in?\n* Colour scheme\n   * Consider swapping some of your colours to lighter variants.  The particular shade of blue used for titles and such, is quite harsh to look at it.

        "content": "I graduated from and work in cybersecurity. A good portion of my job is training the employees to the companies we are contracted to. Things like spotting malicious e-mails, social engineering, etc.\n\nOne area that everyone seems to think they are great in, but usually aren't, is passwords. One example I do in my training is put up a series of password pairs and ask the audience which password is \"stronger\" (depending on the clientele, I'll go into what hashing is and do demonstrations of cracking). The results always surprise me.\n\nOne of our SOC auditors wasn't even aware that NIST had updated their [guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) a few years ago. I think this speaks to how comfortable we all think we are with passwords, *when we really shouldn't be.*\n\nNow a days, your password is the key to your life. There are more malicious actors now than ever, using more sophisticated tools than ever. You should know how you can help protect yourself, starting with password hygiene.\n\n**Password Patterns (Avoid These):**\n\n* 77% of passwords containing a single digit append it to the end of their password. 10% of the time, an appended digit will be a \"1\" (includes data where more than one digit was appended). If the password has capitals, 15% of the time it will be a \"1\" ^(\\[2\\]). Adding a 1 to the end of your password has become effectively meaningless for your security.\n* To clarify the above regarding the 10% figure: The data set has passwords with varying number of digits (\"pass123\", \"pass2134325\", \"pass1\", etc.). Of *all* passwords which have *any number* digits appended, 10% of those only append a single \"1\".\n* 35% of passwords requiring a capital letter will capitalize the first letter ^(\\[2\\]).\n* 89% of 7-character long alpha strings can be targeted by either capitalizing the first character or capitalizing the whole string^(\\[2\\]).\n* 61% of passwords are the exact length of the minimum length set in the password policy^(\\[3\\])\\*.\n* \\~10% of users will model their password after their username^(\\[3\\]). ([john.smith@company.com](mailto:john.smith@company.com):Jsmith1)\n\n**Things to Keep in Mind When Creating a Password:**\n\n* Length is *more important* than complexity^(\\[1\\]) . This does not mean complexity is not important, just that length is *more* important. Shoot for length first, then complexity.\n* Avoid common substitutions, as they are baked into [password cracking rule-sets](https://github.com/praetorian-code/Hob0Rules). Common substitutions include: a = @, i = !, s = $, etc. Same with adding a 1 to the end of your password and capitalizing the first character. These are common patterns, and are well-known to crackers.\n* Instead of thinking \"password\" think \"passphrase\". A single dictionary word is extremely bad. Four to five random dictionary words, perhaps separated by spaces or special characters, is robust. *The benefit of a passphrase is that it is easier for you to generate entropy while still remembering your key. Generating entropy through randomized characters is hard, and results in a hard to remember password, meaning you will likely end up with less entropy.*\n* Avoid \"password walking\". This is using a password with adjacent keyboard characters (e.g. \"qwerty\", \"1q2w3e4r\", \"1qaz2wsx\", etc.)\n* Avoid any password present on a password blacklist^(\\[4\\]). Ideally, this should be a baked-in process.\n\n**Passwords in General:**\n\n* You should be using a different password for *every* website. At the very least, your e-mail password should be extremely strong and unique. If someone gets into your e-mail, they can simply reset every other password connected to that e-mail, regardless of how strong they are. Password re-use attacks are common^(\\[5\\]). *I cannot overstate the importance of this one tip.*\n* SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is better than nothing, but [sim-swapping](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/sim-swap-fraud-explained/) has made it inferior to other forms of 2FA and MFA.\n* I, and my colleagues, and many others **strongly recommend a** (non-browser-based, audited) **password manager**. There still seems to be debate about password managers. I will only comment that most security professionals and government agencies encourage the use of them^(\\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\]). *They are not a panacea. Use them in combination with other positive security habits, like frequent backups and 2FA/MFA.*\n\n**For developers and/or administrators:**\n\n* Ditch password resets. There is ample evidence now that users change their passwords in predictable patterns (password1 -> password2 -> password3 -> pa$$word1 -> etc.). Additionally, if users know that they will have to change their passwords, they are more likely to create a weaker -- but more memorable -- password. Passwords should only be force-changed at signs of compromise. Overall, effectiveness of password expiration in meeting its intended goal is weak^(\\[11\\]).\n* Drop the complexity song and dance. These restrictions will often force users into following one of the above exposed patterns of password creation, and there is little evidence that they increase password robustness (as they are currently implemented).\\*\\* The \"inventor\" of password complexity rules has even apologized and admitted there wasn't much empirical data on password security at the time he implemented the rules^(\\[12\\]).\n* Allow paste in password fields. This is less of a problem now, but there are still applications and websites which don't allow pasted passwords. Password managers are more ubiquitous each day. Don't discourage it.\n* Check user passwords against an up-to-date blacklist of common/compromised passwords. There are several tools and implementations to accomplish this.\n\n**Tools and Resources:**\n\n* [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a resource where you enter your e-mail to see if it has appeared in any known breaches catalogued by the website.\n* [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) is a free and open-source software token for 2FA.\n* [NIST 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)\n\n\\-----------\n\n\\* Knowing the minimum length required by policy, and knowing that 61% of passwords are that length will significantly increase the speed of password cracking.\n\n\\*\\* There is ongoing research into the benefits of having multiple rules in a \"pool\", of which a few are randomly selected to be applied on a user-to-user basis. (e.g. Alice must include a number and be a minimum length of 10 characters. Bob must include a special character and a minimum length of 9 characters).\n\n**Sources:**\n\n>\\[1\\] [https://i.imgur.com/zFyBtyA.gif](https://i.imgur.com/zFyBtyA.gif) (note: \"Time to crack\" can be misleading, as it is dependent on things like hardware, methodology, etc. This illustrates the mathematics of length > complexity only)  \n>  \n>\\[2\\] [http://www.cs.umd.edu/\\~jkatz/security/downloads/passwords\\_revealed-weir.pdf](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/security/downloads/passwords_revealed-weir.pdf)  \n>  \n>\\[3\\] [https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/beyond-password-length-complexity/](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/beyond-password-length-complexity/)  \n>  \n>\\[4\\] [https://github.com/wikimedia/password-blacklist](https://github.com/wikimedia/password-blacklist)  \n>  \n>\\[5\\] [https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/github-accounts-targeted-in-password-reuse-attack/](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/github-accounts-targeted-in-password-reuse-attack/)  \n>  \n>\\[6\\] [https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/07/19/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager/](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/07/19/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager/)  \n>  \n>\\[7\\] [https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-reasons-why-you-should-use-a-password-manager/](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-reasons-why-you-should-use-a-password-manager/)  \n>  \n>\\[8\\] [https://www.csoonline.com/article/3344298/password-managers-remain-an-important-security-tool-despite-new-vulnerability-report.html](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3344298/password-managers-remain-an-important-security-tool-despite-new-vulnerability-report.html)  \n>  \n>\\[9\\] [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/password-managers](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/password-managers)  \n>  \n>\\[10\\] [https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/password-managers-security-itsap30025](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/password-managers-security-itsap30025)  \n>  \n>\\[11\\] [https://www.cs.unc.edu/\\~reiter/papers/2010/CCS.pdf](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~reiter/papers/2010/CCS.pdf)  \n>  \n>\\[12\\] [https://specopssoft.com/blog/father-password-rules-sorry-wasting-time/](https://specopssoft.com/blog/father-password-rules-sorry-wasting-time/)\n\nEdit 1: Clarified the comment regarding appended digits to passwords. 10% of the time when digits are appended to a password, it is a 1.

Je suis un jeune étudiant qui souhaite, comme tout le monde ici, placer intelligemment son épargne. Je m’en remets donc à vous pour avoir vos avis sur comment je compte m’y prendre. J’ai essayé d’être le plus explicite et lisible possible en un minimum de longueur. Je remercie d’avance ceux qui liront jusqu’au bout. :)   \n \n\n\\- Âge : 21 ans en Septembre 2020.   \n\\- Situation familiale : célibataire et entièrement soutenu financièrement par mes parents (Père chef d’entreprise, CSP++, autour de 150k par an, je précise car j’estime que ce soit important pour éviter les conseils excessifs en termes de prudence).   \n\\- Existant immobilier : Aucun à titre personnel (1% symbolique dans une SCI de mes parents).   \n\\- Patrimoine financier :   \n  \\- Livret A : 21 885 euros.   \n  \\- PEL : 4 145 euros. Ouvert en 2014.  \n  \\- Livret Jeune : 1 817 euros.   \n  \\- Compte courant : 300 euros. \n\n\\- Dépenses : J’ai la chance d’avoir toutes mes dépenses couvertes par mes parents (loyer, loisirs, études) et justement je ne veux pas me reposer sur ces acquis. Très probablement cette situation durera encore 3 ans jusqu’à la fin de mes études (je ne compte pas dans mes revenus les éventuelles rémunérations de stages/alternances) et mon premier emploi. \n\n\\- Objectifs financiers (vu ma situation d’étudiant rattaché à mes parents) je souhaite, avant d’avoir mon premier emploi stable, :   \n  A) Placer intelligemment l’épargne de mon Livret A dans une AV et un PEA.   \n  B) Adopter la meilleure stratégie pour mieux placer l’épargne de mon PEL au vu de la date   \n d’ouverture (il me reste peu de temps avant la perte des avantages). \n\n**Ce à quoi j’ai pensé.** \n\n**1) Concernant mon Livret A.**   \n  \\- Je n’y conserve qu’un matelas de sécurité : 3000 euros. Je considère que je peux me permettre de ne pas y garder davantage car j’ai de très bonnes relations avec mes parents et pas d’inquiétudes concernant leur aide en cas de problèmes, donc autant enlever un maximum de capital.   \n  \\- Le reste (18 885) servirait à faire les versements mensuels vers l’AV et/ou PEA pendant 3 ans jusqu'à mon premier emploi. \n\n**2) Concernant mon PEL.** \n\n\\- Informations générales :  \n  \\- Date d’ouverture : 2014.   \n  \\- Taux d’intérêt : 2,5% brut (3,5% en comptant prime d’Etat).  \n  \\- Il me reste 4 ans avant de ne plus pouvoir y faire de versements.   \n  \\- Arrivé à 12 ans, mon PEL sera imposé à la flat tax 30 % donc il me restera 1,75 % net.   \n  \\- Arrivé à 15 ans, ma banque me le transformera en un livret au taux du moment. \n\n\\- Objectif :   \n  \\- Rentabiliser un maximum les 4 ans qu’il me reste pour y faire des versements avant de profiter des taux qui vont décroître au fil du temps. \n\n**3) Concernant mes idées d’investissements.** \n\n***3.1) Assurance vie***\n\n\\- Ouvrir une AV type défensif, 100% fonds euros classique en gestion libre.   \n \\- Je pensais à Linxea Vie qui semble être le plus recommandé pour les débutants proches de mon profil et qui demande 300 euros initiaux.   \n \\- Allouer 90% du capital que je compte investir (Les 18 855 euros ; la répartition entre le montant initial à placer et les versements mensuels est à définir)  \n \\- Je n’ai pas l’impression qu’il soit pertinent de diversifier les AV à mon niveau vu le peu de capital à disposition. \n\n***3.2) PEA*** \n\n\\- Ouvrir un PEA en gestion libre (car la gestion pilotée ne serait pas vraiment intéressante à mon niveau), 100% MSCI Europe. Néanmoins je n’ai pas fait suffisamment de recherches donc je m’en remettrai surtout à vos recommandations.   \n \\- Je pensais à Bourse Direct qui semble être parmi les plus recommandés.   \n \\- Allouer 10% du capital (moins?) que je compte investir (Les 18 855 euros). L’idée est surtout d’ouvrir le PEA pour enclencher le compte à rebours (je compte peu m’y consacrer jusqu’à ce que je touche mon premier vrai salaire). \n\nMerci à ceux qui auront lu !"

        "content": " I worked LE for almost 17 years, 13 in an organized crime unit in one of the largest cities in Texas. Other than sociopaths being very present in the ranks of LE, something I dont see covered a lot is the way they are trained. There is a very dark, Orwellian underside to police training in this country and its NEVER addressed.\n\nIn most academies, they DRILL into you that its \"you against them\" and that every call is a potential deadly-threat situation. They ingrain it into your training to treat every single encounter with the worst outcome in the back of your mind. Officer safety is handled perfectly fine by other countries, especially in Europe, without police officers killing and maiming folks. It boils down to training.\n\nUse of force training in my academy (one of the highest rated in the United States) was always fear-based. You were shown horrific videos of cops being killed (very rare) and instructors drilled into your head the \"warrior mentality\" and all the \"make sure you go home at the end of your shift\" bullshit. Police (largely) are taught to fear folks they come into contact with in certain encounters. Especially when they are violent / complicated interactions or calls.\n\nIts an old adage, but \"when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\" The militarization of police only exacerbates this. Before all the \"Tacti-Cool\" bootlicker dipshits brigade this, I'll just say this. I was in two encounters in my LE career where I received gunfire, and was shot once (in the vest). I was also in several combat encounters in the military. So you dorks defending police militarization can fuck right off. Your Under Armour cap, 9-11 pants, AR you carry into McDonalds and hidden knife lanyard don't impress me. You look like a goddamned idiot.\n\nFurther, situations like the Breonna Taylor shooting are straight up murder. Period. End of story. I worked in a unit that did vice investigations, and have written many, MANY search warrants, and done many, MANY investigations. None of what was reported by the police made sense in that case. The official \"narrative\" was framed. Breonna was murdered because the officers doing this investigation fucked up.\n\nIn regards to hands-on use of force resulting in the death of an arrestee.. Think of how many times this has probably happened that weren't caught on camera. Think of every time before cell-phone cams or body cams, how often someone died in custody. Google \"Positional Asphyxia\" and go down that rabbit-hole. How many George Floyds are there out there whose family have no closure?\n\nSpoiler alert; a LOT. I'm not sure how this gets solved, or even if it can BE solved. I know it would be a helluva lot easier with a competent person in the White House right now. One that could unite, rather than divide. All the MAGA Dipshits this offends, well, fuck you too.\n\nThis is turning into a way longer post than I wanted, I just wanted to get some anger out. There is so much more to say.\n\n Edit; Look up the book / video series called \"The Bulletproof Mind\". Read an excerpt or watch one of the author's (Dave Grossman) videos. If this doesn't terrify you... Our use of force training included a video from this psycho. This is something that also needs to be bigger news. Also Google \"1033 Program\". Its a fed program that transfers military surplus vehicles, weapons, and MUNITIONS, to law enforcement. This program needs to be ended. Another good topic for inspiring journalists to tackle. I guarantee you it would piss a ton of folks off when this program was scrutinized."

This event consisted of hanging out and hotel  party’s with likeminded ppl. I went not knowing anyone but soon clicked with the guys i was rooming with. \n\nMy intentions were to simply have fun. I made no effort to peruse any women and treated them like I would anyone else. I wanted to see if the image of conference alone could attract a women. I walked with my back straight, shoulders back, and with purpose. I didn’t wanna come off as a dickhead but I also wanted to give off the sense that it was my resort and my party. \n\nBy day 2, people were naturally gravitating to me, something I’ve never experienced. I eventually had a girl basically begging for my attention, she was showing all the signs that point to ‘I wanna fuck you’. I said absolutely NOTHING that would make her think I was even slightly interested. Again, I was just there to have fun.\n\n(Side note: I’m 27 and have attended my fair share of party’s but could never hookup with anyone)\n\nEven though I knew what she was saying, I wanted to see how far she would go without me pursuing her. It got to the point where she just looked at me and said “I’m going back to my room” and that’s when I made my move. the rest is history. After the event, I felt like a new man entirely. I went to the bathroom and looked myself in the mirror in disbelief of what happened, and I owe it all to the advice I was given. The girl I slept with assumed I was a player who got around quite often, which couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nSeriously guys, I’m nothing special. I’m 5’9, my nose is big, I have long hair, I wear glasses and I have an average build. If I can do this shit, so can you. You’re given advice every day, it’s up to you wether you actually put it to the test."

The goal of war is to win. By surrounding the enemy, you would force him only to fight more desperately. If you surround him on three sides and leave him an escape route, he will leave your land and there will less blood spilled on both sides. For a warrior of the Mandinka, courage is not enough.\n\n\nKunta Kinti : But sir, won't an enemy who escapes alive fight you again?\n\n\nKintango : It is impossible to kill an enemy. You may end a man's life, but his son becomes your new enemy. A warrior respects another warrior, even he is his enemy. A warrior kills only to protect his family, or to keep from becoming a slave. We believe not in death, but in life, and there is no object more valuable than a man's life.

(Have to still pay your hosting costs which just exploded all at once) DDoS can precede far more damning attacks.\n\nFor example HOW a system failed under DDoS attack can be quite informative of what parts of the system have gone neglected / cheaper out on.\n\nWhen the site started failing were database queries failing before it went down? If so that database server or the website's software probably is being neglected, so good chance there's holes to be exploited there.\n\nWhat if the website itself just times out on static pages? Well that tells me the hosting server probably has issues or the software there is under specced, again might be a good target.\n\nPlus not everyone handles software practices well, bad error handling throwing errors as systems struggle that can expose call stack information or otherwise leak sensitive and exploitable information.\n\nLikely the individuals running the website desperate to get it back up and running are going to be rushing to mitigate the attack. This can often involve making code changes to reduce frequency and load of requests, queries, etc in a rush. Rushed code is buggy code, buggy code is exploitable code. All it takes it's a dev caching sensitive data incorrectly and now you've got a data leak, or in a rush to rework a resource expensive query forgets to sanitize an input now you're leaking data plus you database is potentially in danger, etc.\n\nPoint is DDoS are costly to victims in themselves, but often major data breaches are found to have started shortly after a DDoS attack concluded as it was one of the tools the attackers used to probe their target for possible attack vectors. (Shortly being weeks to months later)\n\n**Edit for grammars**\n\nGeez this blew up, RIP my notifications. Thank you kind strangers for the coins, badges, etc.\n\nPlenty of good security resources out there for those curious, if you're looking for resources to start check out \"Security Now\" it's a good podcast if it's still around. Troy Hunt's Pluralsight courses are also a good choice to learn more, but aren't free. They're both beginner to intermediate stuff. \n\nResources on advanced topics you tend to have to handle one by one. (Hear about new attack vector or theoretical attack vector, look up and research said attack vector, repeat until you retire because there is ALWAYS a new attack vector to learn about)"

One major task is jumping back and forth between different networks and spectrum frequencies: 4G, WiFi, LTE, Bluetooth, etc. The current radio-frequency switches that perform this task are always running, consuming precious processing power and battery life.\n\n“Radio-frequency switches are pervasive in military communication, connectivity and radar systems,” said Dr. Pani Varanasi, division chief, materials science program at ARO. “These new switches could provide large performance advantage compared to existing components and can enable longer battery life for mobile communication, and advanced reconfigurable systems.”\nThe journal Nature Electronics published the research team’s findings.\n\n“It has become clear that the existing switches consume significant amounts of power, and that power consumed is useless power,” said Dr. Deji Akinwande, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering who led the research. “The switch we have developed can transmit an HDTV stream at a 100GHz frequency, and that is an achievement in broadband switch technology.”\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-020-0416-x"

Remember that if she is seeing you right now, you are the best romantic option she has right now otherwise she wouldn't be here*.\n\nNow that we parked the inner game topic, here's a simple structure to have in mind during your interaction with her.\n\n**A date is a goal-oriented interaction**, not just a get-together where you chat and part ways. There has to be a kind of intent in your interaction and a progression to the date.\n\nI basically do five things during a date: **open**, **set intent**, **evaluate**, **build rapport** and then **close**. Why do I do that in that sequence? Let me explain why:\n\n* First, why are you going on that date? What's your objective? Let's consider that your goal is to get her number / kiss her / fuck her / be her boyfriend (pick one). Let's call that **close**.\n* In order to close you need to interact with her, actually go on the date, right? So you need to **open**.\n* Now think from her perspective, if a guy just opens and then tries to close, she will resist. Why? How does she feel? Well, she doesn't know if she wants to talk to you, she doesn't see you as a potential mating partner, she doesn't know if she is into you, she doesn't know if she can be vulnerable to you. So, before you close, you have to let her know that you are here for a **man to woman interaction** (set intent), that you **like her for some reason** (evaluate) and that you can be **close each other** (build rapport).\n* Even if you do this right, one thing missing is that she has to **be attracted to you**. For her to be attracted you have to be an attractive man and behave like one. This is why you create tension, tease, tell stories, play games, banter...\n\nTherefore, what you should do is the following:\n\n1. **Open** with an effortless, fun, nice conversation so with the goal that she is ok to be here talking to you right now. E.g., \"You look like a fun and extrovert girl, I like your energy it's quite.. special\"\n2. **Set intent**: make sure you're in a man to woman interaction (and that there is an open position for her to fill). E.g., \"I'm not sure this is going to work between you and me ;)\"\n3. **Evaluate**: let her know that as the interaction goes, you ended up becoming attracted to her because of traits other than looks that she displayed and that are unique. You have to give her a reason why you want to **close** other than she's pretty. For that you have to know her more. E.g., tell me something special about you that you usually don't tell guys, I'm asking you because I feel you are not like others. I also like to have fun interactions with her that allow me to explore her personality a bit more\n4. **Build rapport**: introduce \"we\", create a common story, build trust, see the world together. E.g., \"do you realize we work right next to each other? What are the odds... I mean we would get married, have three children and die of old age, without even leaving the city or this neighbourhood, what a sad life...\"\n5. **Close**: make your move. You MUST build physical intimacy i.e. escalate physically for you to reach this point. E.g., \"Come here.. I like the way you smell... this kind of scent makes me want to cuddle... do you like to cuddle? hmm... *look at her, look at her lips, look at her again* kiss her\". Easiest way to escalate is to have fake reasons to touch her like checking her accessories, drawing maps on her hand... The right order of kino is something like this: shoulder, forearm, back of the hands, hands, lower back, hair, face, kiss, outside of the legs, belly, ass, then NSFW\n\nIf you are not very experienced, the first step is to get used to the overall flow. See this as a blank template on which you can add in your personality and touch. Progressively, you will be able to break down more and more in detail as you get more experienced.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?"

        "content": "UK-based EMT and training paramedic here, would love some input from EMS across the pond.\n\nThe police actions here are obviously unforgivable, but I want to address what happened after about 6:50.\n\nThe ambulance arrives, and a medic walks up and checks for a carotid pulse for about 5 seconds. We don't know if he found a pulse, but as general rule when an article says someone \"died a short time later\" what it really means is they died on scene, and were pronounced in hospital.\n\nThe medic then leaves, and returns with a stretcher. This man is manhandled onto the stretcher, and then put in the ambulance. The camera pans away so we don't know if one of the officers got onto the ambulance, but we can see two poke around it and ask questions. Then, after about 2 minutes on scene, the ambulance leaves.\n\nLet me explain why *everything* about what they did is wrong, by talking through how I would have managed the scene.\n\nOn arrival, both myself and my partner would get the basic life support bag and defibrillator and take it to the patient. I don't care if you parked with your door touching the patient, you take those to every job. I would be shouting at the officer to get off the patient's neck long before I got there, and told him and all his buddies to go manage the crowd etc. Then, and this is drilled into you from day 1, I'd check for a response, and his airway, breathing and circulation, in that order. ABC, it's not hard to remember.\n\nSo, open his airway, opting not to move his neck as he's obviously had spinal trauma, then check for breathing for 10 seconds, then check his pulse for 10 seconds. Now personally, given the circumstances I don't this this man was breathing adequately, but I'll list both possibilities.\n\nIf he wasn't breathing, and didn't have a pulse, then that's what we call in the biz a cardiac arrest, and there are super strict algorithms to follow which start with exposing the chest and starting compressions. I'd get my partner to set up some oxygen, slap some defibrillator paddles on and then I'd be getting him to radio for backup. Notice that we haven't tried to move the patient, and I don't think I would until we got some support. Then you're talking IV drugs, intubation, all that Gucci shit before we start moving.\n\nIf he was breathing, I'd be looking to see how effective it is. Regardless of what I found, he'd be getting high-flow oxygen as a priority due to hypoxia. If needed I'd be supporting his breathing by squeezing a bag. Then, and only then, would I consider moving the patient to do an assessment in the ambulance. An assessment, not transport.\n\nAs for moving the patient, as I said you've got to think about spinal damage, so getting him onto the stretcher would require some lifting and immobilising equipment. We don't just ragdoll patients until they land where we want them to.\n\nOnce we're on the ambulance, that is my domain, and the police can fuck off unless I've got a combative patient. You want to know if you've killed him? Wait for the coroner to tell you, I'm busy.\n\nOverall, this is absolutely shocking display from the medical crew here, and I wouldn't be surprised if they end up in an investigation. Once you're in scene, that is *your* patient, and nothing should stop you from giving that patient the best chance of life.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards, as this is being seen by a fair few people I'd like to urge everyone to either learn basic life support (CPR, choking, recovery position) or else refresh your training. Even if you can't do a formal course, there's a million resources online, and while I doubt this officer would have let you save this man's life, you may end up saving someone else's.\n\nEdit: Woken up to quite a few responses about scene safety, and maybe that being the reason why they just grabbed him and ran. Scene safety is about whether it is safe to proceed - if you don't think it's safe then you don't go in, not \"we'll just go in real quick to grab him.\" Plus, if you have safety concerns about the patient, taking them to a confined space is probably a bad idea. If you have safety concerns about the crowd, get the police to manage it. If you have safety concerns about the police, then man, I feel for you.\n\nLate edit: Just an added bit of information, [here's the scene as seen from across the road](https://i.redd.it/js8dmslo48151.jpg) (not my caption)."

That means they could do what they want, searching people’s house without permission. Imagine if a person was living alone, who would know if he/she was arrested secretly. \n\n2. \nProhibit behaviors claimingly harmful to national security, and regularly report to the CCP. The HKSAR will definitely do more about nationally security education. The teachers, textbooks or lessons may have to examine by the government before. \n\nIn the past year, there were already teachers being fired/ punished just because they had opinions on police brutality, or about the government. People have no right to express our opinions. \n\nWe are worried about our next generation will be brainwashed. Our students have a subject general studies, students have to learn about history, economic, news and so on, trained to have critical thinking. But now they said this is not good. They want to control what we think, to see what they want us to see, to learn what they want us to know. \n\nI dont know how will Hong Kongers become after 10 or 20 years. Hong Kong may become another city which totally different from now. We are scared. For me, I wont consider to have baby, I just couldnt imagine how they would grow up.

We know that the UI is the middle man between users and a machine that gives access to a  specific service, but how could our phones have access to the big data spotify or google or facebook have? \n\nHere come APIs. You can think of APIs as the machine's equivalent to the UI. An API is the middle man between the machine you're using and the services you want to use that would make it easier for the machine to send requests and receive responses based on the user's input.\n\nTo sum up. The UI is a middle man you can interact with to send orders regarding a service to a machine. The machine has its own middle man (the API) that will help fetch the information need and send the requests desired to a service.\n\nIf this doesn't clear things up. You can take a look at [APIs for beginners](https://youtu.be/GZvSYJDk-us) from freeCodeCamp."

        "title": "You new guys are seriously misunderstanding the point of seduction.",
        "content": "There is a new trend here in r/seduction. People in here are coming in and looking around and then leaving posts and comments about how cringey it is that people rely on the advice here. Others are coming in and asking questions about PUA concepts that should have been left in the early 2000s or whining about how the girl they talked to did not want to give them her number. All of these people seem to fundamentally not understand the point of this sub and how the concept of seduction works. Hell, one guy just lauded Models while criticizing the sub as if that is not the most highly recommend book of all time here. Clearly that person has not been paying attention, Mark Manson is listed on the sidebar.\n\nSeduction is not magic. Cold Approaching is not necessary depending on your goals. Inner Game is self development and improvement. It's about living a life that is satisfying for yourself, and not for the sake of getting laid. When you achieve this, you will be more confident and you will carry yourself like a successful person. This will naturally lead you to more and more organic opportunities to meet people. Outer Game is how you capitalize on the opportunities you encounter. How to greet people, listen to what they have to say, and look them in the eyes. How to keep yourself from asking mindless interview questions, how to tell a compelling story, and how to build up to a kiss. These are all practical skills involved when getting someone's number and/or having a successful first date. When you put these together, you become Don Juan. **That does not mean you can have whoever you want.** Nobody can have whoever they want. If someone promised you that, they were lying to sell you stuff. **You cannot have whoever you want, but you can have a successful dating life regardless.** The sooner you start reading the sidebar and stop clicking on the YouTube links promising to get you laid in 5 minutes flat, the sooner you will find success. \n\nIf you are new here, you came here for a reason, and there are indeed ways to improve yourself. If you are seriously not sure where to start, then start here: [Inner Game](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gjqim/the_definitive_seddit_inner_game_collection/). Then read Models by Mark Manson. It is on Audible. Then go talk to people and see if you do not have a better grasp on social interactions. \n\nIf you think this is an incel sub, a sub for hating women, a sub for \"nice guys\" or assholes, or a sub for tricking people into liking you, then **you are wrong.** This is a sub for people who choose to have success in their personal and romantic relationships, even if you were not born or raised with the best social skills. This sub is for people who want to become better, and more successful versions of themselves. If you are not willing to concede that you need to improve, then nothing will help you. There is no faking it till you make it, women can smell that a mile away. If you are willing to put in the effort to actually be a better you, the information in this sub can change your life.\n\nFor outsiders just browsing around here, you are uninformed about what you are talking about and your immediate inclinations to criticize are mistaken. Some people are not gifted with the best social skills. These are mostly people with good intentions who want and deserve to experience romance and stronger relationships. The fact that these people seek out advice is not cringey. It is the first sign of someone who is dedicated to improvement. The advice here leads to better experiences for everyone involved. This sub does not make anyone cringey, they come here to kill their cringey habits and behaviors. If you see any advice here that involves trickery or dishonesty, those are not from the well known and respected people in this community. Stop telling people they should feel bad for wanting to be better. \n\nAlso, screw the fake PUAs around here who are shilling their products. You are ripping people off by promising them the world and then not delivering. If you are considering dropping a grand on some product, do not do it. The content can be found for far cheaper. Your nearest big city has a community that would gladly be your wingmen and give you tips for free. A weekend trip to the city is just a fraction of the cost of a bootcamp for the same content and accountability. \n\n\nIf there are any veterans out there, let us try to keep this sub from falling apart. I know this content changed my life, I will try to pay it forward more. \n\nYou got this guys.\n\nTLDR: Read it, it's important\n\n**Misc. Tips:**\n\n* The Game by Neil Strauss is not an instruction manual, it is a lesson and a warning\n\n* Nick Sparks and James Marshall are two excellent coaches with videos on YouTube that you should check out. No bullshit, just down to earth conversations and advice\n\n* If you do not go to the gym, start going\n\n* The advice here is not intended to help your long term committed relationship. Once you reach that point, you probably have the skills you need. Stop listening to this shit and start listening to your partner\n\n* There is no \"nice guy\"/\"asshole\" dichotomy. Kind people who are also confident and assertive are attractive people \n\n* Use a condom or you **will** get an STD you fuck\n\n* A girl is not your girlfriend unless she has said the words, \"I am your girlfriend.\" Do not make assumptions\n\n* If your Instagram does not make you look like a rockstar or a model, stop DMing girls. It is creepy"

When the interviewer asks the question: what salary are you looking for?, instead of listing what you’re expecting ask them instead. \n\nI always start with explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about experience to “this position”). \n\nOftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. \n\nThis also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of under selling yourself! (If they’re expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they’re not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).\n\nEdit to add: a bunch of commenters are making valid points. Do your research, know your worth and what the worth of the position is. If the company lowballs you, ask for more if you feel comfortable. Salaries are often part of a negotiation, and if you know you deserve more then advocate for it. Prove to them that you’re worth the investment, because if they’re not willing to pay you what you deserve (provided they can AFFORD to do so, some businesses just don’t have the funds to meet the same pay as another business) then you have to consider if they’re worth your time. Does the money matter for you to accept the job, and if the answer is yes then get it!\n\nEdit #2: Thank you to everyone for the awards! I treasure every one of them since these are my first time receiving them!"

        "title": "I never realised that losing my love for reading was a sign of depression.",
        "content": "Recently I have started trying to get back into reading. I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. \n\nI always told myself “I’m just too stressed with school”, “oh I’m just in a reading slump I’ll come out of it soon”, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. \n\nIt wasn’t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. \n\nShe said “oh you’re turning into me”. \n\nI wasn’t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn’t a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I’m somewhat on the uphill, I’m finding my footing in the reading world again.\n\nEdit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. \n\nWe are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. \n\nMy goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life."

Work towards short term or immediate goals, things you want or would like to do and don't worry about your overall \"purpose\" or \"goals\". As you achieve these things, your life starts to narrow and focus and your short term goals start being replaced by medium term ones, and then long term ones.\n\nFor me, it started when I saw how much I had paid in rent over the previous year. I thought \"this is ridiculous, I could afford a house for this money\" and a lightbulb went off. I was working a dead end job and had no life goals, but buying a house became my immediate goal. Worked my ass off, and a year later my wife and I bought our house. After that, we started thinking about kids and that made me reflect on my career and decide to change and improve my career path. Everything started cascading like dominos after that, falling into place.\n\nThese sorts of life changes and goals, while not a grander purpose, help you realize what it is you truly want to do, be, and go in life. That's when the larger picture starts to reveal itself to you."

        "content": "I've been on reddit (including lurking) for over seven years, and this site has definitely changed a *lot* since I first started posting. My observations are detailed below. These in no way apply to literally *every* redditor, nor are they exclusive to reddit:\n\n* **Redditors have a groupthink:** There is a consistent pattern of beliefs, whether ideological or cultural, that tend to be common across major subreddits. So when I'm saying \"redditors,\" I'm pointing out trends I see in the groupthink.\n\n* **Redditors love siege mentalities:** They simultaneously crave affirmation from the masses for their beliefs and the feeling that they're being wrongly persecuted by the masses for their beliefs. It's the reason why \"I'm probably gonna be downvoted for this, but...\" comments are so popular, despite the opinion they express being neither controversial or brave. It's also like how the admins are simultaneously crypto-communist SJW white knights for refusing to ban SRS and crypto-fascist alt-right enablers for refusing to ban T_D; whatever ideology you are, the admins oppose it and are trying to silence you.\n\n* **Redditors love feeling smart:** They always want to show off how they're the smartest person in the room (or in the thread), and they love the feeling of having a special *gnosis* that the average person doesn't have. They're obsessed with calling people out and dropping some truth bombs to show how much smarter they are than everyone else. Even if it's completely incorrect, anyone who makes a long-winded post saying \"You're wrong OP and here's why\" with bunch of links will be upvoted.\n\n* **Redditors jump to conclusions:** This is especially common on news posts, where people base all their stances on an (often editorialized) title and rarely, if ever, bother to read the actual article. By the time someone cites the argument from the article, the most upvoted ones are probably completely unfounded.\n\n* **Redditors are cynical:** Go to any news post, especially about politics, the environment, the economy, and the coronavirus pandemic, and people will bemoan how it is too late to do anything, the world is in a downward spiral, and some major disaster is lurking around every corner. There's a general attitude that the more panicked or nihilistic you are, the more intelligence you appear.\n\n* **Redditors are contrarian:** They like to view themselves as countercultural, above the petty influences of popular opinion, and choosing what they truly believe in. More often than not, they end up being like goths who shop solely at Hot Topic—they are all identically unique.\n\n* **Redditors are manichaean and dogmatic:** There can be no neutral or nuanced stance on opinions on this site. Your side is God, the other side is the Devil. Everything can cleanly and neatly placed into one category or the other. Go onto /r/freefolk and say \"Season 8 was a dip in quality, but I still think *Game of Thrones* remained above-average television.\" Any sign of contradiction with the groupthink, insufficient dedication, or acknowledgement of goodness on the other side is immediately reviled as secret sympathy for the other side.\n\n* **Redditors are pop culture conspiracy theorists:** Building off the above point, something can't just be good or bad, but there must be elaborate motives for doing so. Every piece of media *has* to have a hamfisted political agenda inside it, and if there isn't one, people will dig around until they think they've found one. Game companies can't just make products, they have to be made by either pure angels who love the fans or soulless corporate fat cats who want you to suffer. To go with /r/freefolk again, they don't believe that the finale was just poorly written. They believe that the showrunners intentionally sabotaged the ending so they could sign a deal with Disney to make a Star Wars trilogy, despite the timeline for that not making any sense at all.\n\n* **Redditors have always been at war with Eastasia:** There's a general sentiment that the zeitgeist at any given moment is how it always was or how it always will be. This is especially notable when it comes to opinions on TV shows, video games, and the like, where opinions change rapidly. How much has /r/gaming gone back and forth between loving and hating studios like Bethesda or Ubisoft? How many /r/prequelmemes posters shit on the sequel films while pretending like the prequels weren't universally reviled for nearly two decades?\n\n* **Redditors fetishize consumerism:** This applies to any hobby subreddit that centers around a consumer good (/r/vinyl, /r/gamecollecting, /r/watches, /r/fountainpens, etc.). Oftentimes, those who purchase the fanciest equipment are the most praised in the sub, and those who don't (or can't) are ridiculed as plebeians who aren't dedicated enough.\n\n* **Redditors fetishize obscurity:** This applies to any hobby subreddit that deals with things relating to personal taste or pop culture (music, literature, fictional lore, etc.). The ability to profess knowledge of the most obscure and esoteric thing possible is praised as being a superior member of the community.\n\n* **Redditors are not funny:** Oftentimes, they believe that rote recitation of song lyrics, film/TV quotes, memes, and other bite-sized pop culture references are an adequate substitute for humor in any given scenario."

So you can imagine how much time I’ve spent thinking about bats. \n\nHere’s some answers about why they always seem to be the culprit when it comes to outbreaks.\n\n---\n\n# Q: Why is it always bats? (that harbor dangerous viruses that spill over into humans)\n\n# A: It's complicated.\n\n**TL;DR - Bats are a perfect storm of: genetic proximity to humans (as fellow mammals), keystone species interacting with many others in the environment (including via respiratory secretions and blood-transmission), great immune systems for spreading dangerous viruses, flight, social structure, hibernation, etc.**\n\n---\n\nYou may not be fully aware, but unless your head has been stuffed in the sand, you've probably heard, at some point, that X virus \"***lives in bats***.\" It's been said about: **Rabies, Hendra/Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Rift Valley Fever, St. Louis Encephalitis, and yes, SARS, MERS**, and, now probably **SARS-CoV-2** (with the addition of another intermediate species?)\n\n[Bats really do harbor more viruses than other species groups](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/bats-really-do-harbor-more-dangerous-viruses-other-species)!\n\n**But why? Why is it always bats?** The answer lies in the unique niche bats fill in our ecosystem.\n\n[I made dis](https://preview.redd.it/lqjsabpe2nt41.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06fe693ef8de0404636bb704d4aaba21156c2412)\n\n---\n\n# Bats are not that far off from humans genetically speaking\n\nThey're placental mammals that give birth to live young, that are [about as related to us (distance-wise) as dogs](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030002?_sg%5B0%5D=5-_-2_pgWIhDr6YQfI8RQIcqJrXoSs-GlPcy1oj31o-lwx93Pqr2XNO5gRdpjh8RlWuimjxHEuIxQAzZUsOaC2v-Jg.4ZxtM1n7PdeIguwFA_xY00LN0cqRu784dZOaF6gdx3I7e7d3ReGdPq-cF2UejDf7cwWIv8yDiL4Q3eOetfyk6w). Which means **\\~84% of our genomes are identical to bat genomes**. Just slightly less related to us than, say, mice or rats (\\~85%).\n\n*(this estimate is based upon associations in phylogeny. Yes I know bats are a huge group, but it's useful to estimate at this level right now.)*\n\nWhy does this matter? **Well, genetic relatedness isn't just a fun fancy % number. It also means that all the proteins on the surface of our cells are similar as well.**\n\nFor example, [**SARS-CoV-2 is thought to enter our cells using the ACE2 receptor**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6485/1444) (*which is a lil protein that plays a role in regulating blood pressure on the outside of cells in our lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines*). [**The ACE2 between humans and bats is about 80.5% similar**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20567988/) (*this link is to a paper using bat ACE2 to figure out viral entry. I just plugged the bat ACE2 and human ACE2 into [protein blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) to get that 80.5% number*).\n\nTo give you an idea of what that means for a virus that's crossing species barriers, CD4 ([the protein HIV uses to get into T cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18383039/)) is about 98% similar between [chimpanzees](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3229) and humans. HIV likely had a much easier time than SARS-CoV-2 of jumping onto our ship, but SARS-CoV-2 also has a trick up its sleeve: [an extremely promiscuous viral entry protein](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus).\n\nThese viruses use their entry protein and bind to the target receptor to enter cells. The more similar the target protein is between species, the easier it will be for viruses to jump ship from their former hosts and join us on a not-so-fun adventure.\n\nAnother aspect of this is that **there are just so many dang bats**. There are roughly [1,300 bat species](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/bats/) making up [20-25% of all mammals](https://www.csu.edu/cerc/researchreports/documents/BatsActivityGuide.pdf). So the chances of getting a virus from a bat? Pretty good from the get go. *If you had to pick a mammalian species at random, there's a pretty good chance it's gonna be a rodent or a bat.*\n\n[From: http:\\/\\/palaeos.com\\/vertebrates\\/eutheria\\/eutheria2.html \\(https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/kRoRSMU.png\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3zyfdb9i2nt41.png?width=2790&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9431be345ef9f06f756a5ddf3f9505a311618f5)\n\n---\n\n# Bats are in a perfect place to serve as a nexus connecting a bunch of different species together and transmitting viruses\n\nVarious bat species do all or some of:\n\n* [**Drink the blood of other animals**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat) ([*and are in turn fed on by mosquitos*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466281/))\n* [**Eat, piss, and shit**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10900029/) on fruit that other animals eat\n* [**Eat moths, gnats, flies, and mosquitos**](https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/) that have fed on live or dead animals\n* [**Help to pollinate**](https://ucanr.edu/sites/PollenNation/Meet_The_Pollinators/Bats) and spread seeds for a zillion different important plants\n* [**Shit on cave floors, producing precious guano**](https://eos.org/articles/how-bat-breath-and-guano-can-change-the-shapes-of-caves) that is used by fungi and bacteria\n* [**These microorganisms**](https://books.google.com/books?id=IEZwx8PfP5IC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=cave+fungus+eaten+by+salamanders&source=bl&ots=4fy-DzWE8t&sig=ACfU3U1imlPihOHzUXxyw_4hU7FuI_j-bg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiq9pbu5PLoAhVug-AKHXQmCqAQ6AEwFnoECAoQKA#v=onepage&q=cave%20fungus%20eaten%20by%20salamanders&f=false) are then, in turn, eaten by fish, salamanders, frogs, etc.\n* [**Bats are also food**](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170118-monstrous-spiders-and-centipedes-that-prey-on-large-animals) for hawks, weasels, and even arthropods like spiders and centipedes. And yes, even humans eat bats.\n\n**All of this means two things:**\n\n1. **bats are getting and giving viruses from all of these different activities**. Every time they drink the blood of another animal or eat a mosquito that has done the same, they get some of that species' viruses. And when they urinate on fruit that we eat, or if we directly eat bats, we get those viruses as well.\n2. **Bats are, like it or not, an extremely crucial part of the ecosystem that cannot be eliminated.** So their viruses are also here to stay. **The best thing we can do is pass laws that make it illegal to eat, farm, and sell bats and other wild zoonotic animals**, so that we can reduce our risk of contracting their viruses. We can also pass laws protecting their ecological niche, so that they stay in the forest, and we stay in the city!\n\n[From: https:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/10.1177\\/1010539512471965 \\(https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/YeO2R5F.jpg\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/whn9yv2p2nt41.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aebed1de980293868d185cde776cd77923d7a9d)\n\n---\n\n# The bat immune system is well tuned to fight and harbor viruses\n\n[Their immune systems are actually hyper-reactive](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people), getting rid of viruses from their own cells extremely well. This is probably an adaptation that results from the second point: if you encounter a ton of different viruses, then you also have to avoid getting sick yourself.\n\n*This sounds counter-intuitive, right? Why would an animal with an extremely good immune system be a good vector to give us (and other animals) its viruses?*\n\nWell, the theory goes that [**bats act as a sort of \"training school\"**](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-bats-are-breeding-grounds-for-deadly-diseases-like-ebola-and-sars) **where viruses are educated against robust mammalian immune responses**, and learn to [adapt and control the usual mechanisms that mammalian cells use to fight back](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00026/full#h6).\n\nThe second aspect of this is that [**bat immune systems***](https://massivesci.com/articles/bat-immune-systems-ncov-sars-nipah-mers-ebola-coronavirus/) allow for [background replication of viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6410205/) **at a low level, all the time, as a strategy to prevent symptomatic disease**. It's a trade-off, and one that bats have executed perfectly.\n\nIt just happens to mean that **when we get a virus from bats, oh man can it cause some damage**.\n\n*I do have to say this one is mostly theory and inference, and there isn't amazingly good evidence to support it*. *But it's very likely that bat immune systems are different from our own, given [the overall divergence of their immune system genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253856/) in relation [to our own and those of other mammals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025585/).*\n\nMy opinion (*which echoes most ecologists*) is that [it's more about the position that bats hold in the environment](https://www.intechopen.com/books/bats/bats-bat-borne-viruses-and-environmental-changes), their behaviors, their longevity, and their sheer numbers. In general zoonotic transmission is a roulette, and bats have the most positions (*and the most advantageous positions*) on that wheel.\n\nI think this idea has picked up so much steam because molecular biologists often find ways to use what they know about the micro world to explain phenomena in the macro world. It’s honestly probably counterproductive, since most things are quite a bit more complex than we realize while looking at their analogues in Petri dishes.\n\nThat being said, I also think ecologists often underestimate what is possible to figure out in a Petri dish, and undervalue the impact of a robustly well-controlled interventional experiment. But that's a conversation for another day.\n\n---\n\n# Bats can FLY!\n\nThis allows them to travel long distances, meet and interact with many different animals, hunt and be hunted, and survive to tell the tale. **Meaning they also survive to pass on their virus.**\n\n---\n\n# Bats are unusually long lived!\n\n[**Many bat species live longer than 25 years**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882342). On the curve of \"body size and metabolism\" vs \"lifespan\" [bats are a massive over-performer](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/why-do-bats-have-such-bizarrely-long-lifespans/). The closely related foxes, for example, live on average 2-5 years in the wild.\n\nThis is probably interrelated with all the other factors listed. Bats can fly, so they live longer; bats live longer, so they can spread slowly growing virus infections better. This combination of long lifespan and persistent viral infection means that bats may, more often, keep viruses around long enough to pass them onto other vertebrates (like us!).\n\n[From: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pcbi.1004524.g002 \\(https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/7j7DJ3i.png\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yf0ptua23nt41.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1b0403041c35770d932cc4e29fda9837592b41)\n\n---\n\n# Their social structure and hibernation behaviors\n\nThese characteristics are uniquely positioned to help them harbor a number of different viruses.\n\n[Bats roost](https://www.bats.org.uk/about-bats/where-do-bats-live/bat-roosts/what-is-a-roost), meaning they hole up inside the roofs of caves and hibernate together for long periods of time (on the order of months), passing viruses amongst the colony in close isolation. [**The Mexican free-tailed bat, for example, packs \\~300 bats/ft\\^2 in cave systems**](https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/resources/keep-texas-wild/hanging-around-with-bats/a-year-in-the-life-of-a-mexican-free-tailed-bat) **like** [**Carlsbad caverns**](https://www.sunset.com/travel/carlsbad-confidential-the-bats) **in the southwestern United States.**\n\nThe complex social hierarchy of bats also likely plays a role. [**Bats exist in so-called \"micropopulations\" that have different migratory patterns**](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3906%2Fzoo-1508-56?_sg%5B0%5D=JXKzPLHkT5oojZLpKNaB1nsVgJvPk2x0CU3PgN5cO1SQ7hgTmkp0pZjIt6V7g-D_hnmZDJsDvmnZhNBdBsOvW2z-wQ.7zu_Efac5ALLeW8HlJfQISFbNLHoF6T0YXBun1ynaj1X1OeiAUt7geHm5s7BVbeto9mvEXWZ9VSn1Nbcfj_WkA). [They interweave and interact and combine and separate](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1134%2FS1062359014010105?_sg%5B0%5D=bMEntzSErKfgn7qaU7I16nuG74WfvYoY0vmRuuNnUYyo5yT8PLByWYocJ_8fq3oqwJ4MvHD_RXcoa6d1SubJCAoU5Q.EicnSr6EFfAwP2tWm6NSriLyNnbmCTcT-jztT9C18MZkDl42G8G-1anfVhFShDRYXMQaZPXPbN5iKBr4oH5Pug) in a dizzying mix of complex social networks among different \"micropopulations.\"\n\nA given virus may have the chance to interact with hundreds of thousands or millions of different individual bats in a short period of time as a result. This also means that viruses with different life cycles (short, long, persistent, with flare-ups, etc) can always find what they need to survive, since different bat groupings have different habits.\n\n**And** [**this may partially explain how outbreaks of certain viruses happen according to seasonality**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3121824/). If you're a virus and your bat micropopulation of choice is around and out to play, it's more likely you will get a chance to jump around to different species.\n\n[From: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1890\\/ES13-00023.1 \\(https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/QLYevsN.png\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gaoa1mg73nt41.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=e063d91fb62e04e52eeb579afeb246728e91f653)\n\n---\n\n# Echolocation may also play a role\n\nBats echolocate, and it involves the intense production of powerful sound waves, which are also perfect for disseminating lots of small virus-containing respiratory droplets across long distances! ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539106/) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4551426))\n\n---\n\n# Finally, a note on viral ecology in general:\n\n**If you read this post, and think bats are the only ones out there with viruses, then I have failed.**\n\nThe reality is that **every species out there, from the tiniest stink bug to the massive elephant, likely has millions of different viruses infecting it all the time!** If you take [a drop (mL) of seawater, it contains \\~10 million bacteriophages](https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/BF01983537).\n\n**In our genome, there are** [**remnants and scars and evidence of millions of retroviruses that once infected us**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus)**.** Greater than 8% of our genome is made up of these \"endogenous retroviruses,\" most of which don't make any RNA or proteins or anything like that. They just sit there. **They've truly won the war for remembrance**.\n\nThat's what viruses do, **they try and stick around for as long as possible**. *And, in a sense, these endogenous retroviruses have won*. They live with us, and get to stick around as long as we survive in one form or another.\n\n**The vast vast majority of viruses are inert, asymptomatic, and cause no notable disease**. **It is only the very tip of the iceberg, the smallest tiny % of viruses, that cause disease and make us bleed out various orifices**. **Viral disease, in terms of all viruses, is the exception, not the rule. It's an accident.** **We are an accidental host for most of these \"zoonotic\" viruses.**\n\nViruses are everywhere, and it is only the unique and interesting aspects of bats noted above that mean we are forced to deal with their viruses more than other species.\n\n(**Dengue, like most viruses, follows this idea**. The vast majority of people are asymptomatic. Pathogenicity and disease are the exception, not the rule. But that doesn't mean they don't cause damage to society and to lots of people! They do!)\n\n[From: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41577-019-0123-x \\(https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/KcuutRz.png\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3dr6pt3e3nt41.png?width=2124&format=png&auto=webp&s=6df2a3f92293bd8a900a7cd689304963cd7bac02)\n\n**The last thing I want to reiterate at the end of this post is something I said earlier:**\n\n*Bats are a keystone species!*\n\n**A keystone species is one that, when you remove it, the system falls apart. Much like [the  keystone](https://images.app.goo.gl/HNZKSAGdWGzYns9HA) in an arched entryway.**\n\n Removing bats from the Earth would likely kill many more millions of humans than CoVID-19 or Ebola ever could.\n\n\n**We rely on the plants they pollinate for the food we eat and for the air we breathe.**  **We rely on them for pest control and for population control.** **And, in turn, they serve as good for other crucial species.**\n\n\n**Bat populations keep mosquitos like** ***Aedes*** **and** ***Anopheles*** **species in check.** *Aedes Aegypti*  kills many more millions than CoVID-19 by spreading dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika, and other viruses. *Anopheles* females spread malaria, one of the most deadly diseases in human history. **Without bats, these mosquitoes could overgrow to unknown and unpredictable levels, and the diseases they transmit could spread even further, like wildfire, decimating the earth's human population.**  \n\nIn terms of pure biomass and impacts...*to remove 20% of mammals on the Earth*... That could be absolutely devastating! Possibly world-ending on its own.\n\nWe need bats.\n\nWe also don't know what would replace the niche that bats hold in the Earth's ecosystem. And whether or not *that* animal or animals would be worse or better for human zoonotic infections. \n\n\n**We need bats. We just don't need them to be close enough to human society that we contract their viruses so easily.**  \n\n\nOther people have actually done this calculation. And they agree with me:  \n\n(**[1](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v8/n1-2/p93-115/) [2](https://www.theday.com/article/20100421/NWS01/304219877) [3](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-killing-the-bats-16824335/) [4](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-02-08/Bats-may-carry-virus-should-we-kill-them-all--NUxmfimhCU/index.html) [5](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/03/endangered-bats-killed-in-mauritius/) [6](https://fokt.pw/ecosystemservicesprovided.pdf) [7](https://peerj.com/articles/2249/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&utm_medium=TrendMD) [8](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justin_Welbergen/publication/270160641_The_impacts_of_extreme_events_on_biodiversity_-_lessons_from_die-offs_in_flying-foxes/links/54a197c40cf267bdb902c319.pdf) [9](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/35007)**)  \n\n\n>***Bats are, like it or not, an extremely crucial part of the ecosystem that cannot be eliminated.*** *So their viruses are also here to stay.*  \n>  \n>***The best thing we can do is pass laws that make it illegal to eat, farm, and sell bats and other wild zoonotic animals*** *, so that we can reduce our risk of contracting their viruses.

        "content": "Python has a lot of tricks to help optimize code. One of them is that the integers -5 to 255 are preloaded at boot and treated as singletons. All other integers are created as needed. So 300 is created twice, therefore `is` fails. 200 is simply copied twice from the preload area, so `is` returns True. \n\nAnother trick is that all literals in a single block (eg a line of code in the REPL) are combined, so they are only evaluated once. This means that your code acts differently depending on if it was run on one line or multiple lines: \n\n    >>> a = 300\n    >>> b = 300\n    >>> a is b\n    False\n    >>> a, b = 400, 400\n    >>> a is b\n    True\n\nYou'll see more differences in running in the REPL vs a file.\n\n**Edit**: I see some python beginners feeling overwhelmed at this. DON'T BE. If you take anything away it should be that beginners should always use `==`, and never use `is`. The rest is an insignificant piece of trivia on how cpython was programmed, that no one really needs to care about."

I'm happy my SO is getting a confidence boost from someone other than me, and I think it's healthy.\n\nIMO friends don't compliment friends enough, and even though you know your SO is being genuine when they compliment you, honestly it loses value. To know a stranger thinks you're attractive or have a good trait is a good feeling for everyone and I know my bf can sometimes have small self-image issues.\n\nSo thanks to the girls who hit on my boyfriend and make him smile and like looking at himself for a while.

Also the pain points that an hourly plan changes quickly if something comes up in between.\n\nThese points are no different for me. Only I have found the following principles for me.\n\n# Fuck the Plan. Love the planning.\n\n>Plans are worthless, but planning is essential. - Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nA compass does not show me the way home. It shows me at any time whether I am still on the right course. The plan helps to decide what to do.\n\n# Priorities\n\nI use the plan to take an hour before my work (9 to 5) to do the most important task of my most important thing (by the way my definition of when a day was successful).\n\nMostly the distractions come later in the day. And when the Distraction shows up, I look at my plan and do what is simply human. I change my priorities. My parents call me, while I need to do something for my project? Fuck the plan, I am going to talk to them.\n\n# Work schedule restriction\n\nOne of the problems I had was the constant shifting of time blocks. There's a radical way of preventing this. One of the hardest things about the plan:\n\n**If I don't complete the task in time, I am no longer allowed to complete it on the same day.**\n\nThis is called artificial working time restriction and according to studies is helpful against procrastination.\n\n# Potential Additions\n\nThere is one thing I am going to implement in the future. The retrospective plan of the day. If the plan changes, note the activity that distracted you. And as soon as you realize that an activity is coming up more than once and upsets your plan:\n\n**Plan it. Take your time.**\n\nI noticed that I always liked being on Reddit or YouTube, even if I had other plans. When I started planning it, I noticed the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I don't have a guilty conscience about it.**"

        "title": "5 ways to work smarter not harder",
        "content": " \n\n**1.Leverage**\n\nThe first principle to work smarter not harder is called leverage.\n\nOne of the stubborn ways to work harder, and getting scrips, or any of it at all, is to go things about your own. BIG factual mistakes leading to disaster.\n\nWe are here to work, and to be together to build a great world, and that smartest thing to do in your life. We should leverage each other.\n\nThe person who locks himself in his little ego, and claim that doesn’t need help will always get any results, but more so, is more likely to fail.\n\nHaving an open mind is the key. For example, if you want to start a YouTube channel, what most people wanna do? They start searching in the FREE Taking hours, and hours of their times, being all over the place, confused, and guess what at end? Tiny results. That the sloppy way of working.\n\nA smart person on the other hand, will leverage other people’s experiences, by buying a step by step course, or asking for coaching, to point out the right direction, avoiding pitfalls, saving years, and making enormous results. That’s working SMART.\n\n**2.Start with the difficult, and most important task first.**\n\nThe second thing you would do to work smarter not harder is to begin the hardest task. Here’s why:\n\nYou see, the only thing that is hindering us from getting to our goals is **procrastination**.\n\nBuilding momentum is a muscle like any muscle in your body.\n\nWhen you start with a difficult task, this muscle will reinforce itself, as time goes on, your ability to kick your ass off will become easier, and from that, results will be attained much faster.\n\nAlso know that we just have such a great amount of time in one day.\n\nIn the event that you believe that you will almost certainly achieve each and every thing on your monstrous plan for the day, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nThis is for what reason I’m a major devotee to concentrating my time on the most significant assignment first.\n\nSometimes we get confused, we have some much tasks to complete throughout the day. One tips for you, is to organize them. Probably you’re asking how can I do it. **The solution is Eisenhower Box.**\n\n**Eisenhower Box is** one of the best productivity tools that will help to structure your task In order of priority, and urgency, so you can be able to save time, and energy.\n\n**3.Be More Mindful**\n\nWith regards to completing things, one of the greatest difficulties that individuals face is having the option to concentrate on the job needing to be done.\n\nThe brain is continually meandering, which implies that it’s anything but difficult to get occupied. Stalling benefits from this state.\n\nSo as to be productive, individuals expect that they must be always accomplishing and doing. The emphasis is dependably on the following thing that they have to do, or the following spot that they should be. Accordingly, they are never completely right now.\n\n**4.Say No to multitasking**\n\nOur brain’s marvelous. A lot of people think can do anything with it. Yes there’s some kind of truth to that, but when it comes to multitasking, it’s a bad servant.\n\nOur focus is severely limited, and when we try to focus on different tasks, you know what happens: Our attention goes all over the place, we become agitated, confused, and nothing is done at the end.\n\nTo get things done quickly, effectively, do one thing at one, then move on to the other one, and so forth.\n\n**5.Manage and relief stress.**\n\nSince stress can cause physical, enthusiastic, and conduct issues – which can affect your well being, vitality, prosperity, and mental sharpness – it’s nothing unexpected that pressure frustrates your work execution.\n\nHere are some simple things that you can do to relief stress, and rejuvenate yourself:\n\n* reading a good book.\n* spending time with friends or family,\n* Go for a walk.\n* Spend time on a creative hobby"

Then they take all of their unpaid bills and show the government, “Look how much free healthcare we gave, please give us assistance”\n\nI’m like this is what you do to people who are ill? \n\nIt’s frustrating because doctors end up being caught in the middle of it and all we’re trying to do is help people in need\n\nSide rant: The core of this problem is how hospitals justify this by saying they’re barely staying afloat yet health care is an incredibly profitable business. That’s the issue, running a hospital is not a profitable business but health care is profitable. It’s the equipment companies, supply companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc.. that are profiting. All of us are just stuck in their traps."

        "content": "Kudos, you're wiser than 16yo me. Hold on firmly to your central tenet, with introspection it'll illuminate the right answer in the darkest of times. \n\nComing back to your question, I'll start by saying that \"women\" (or \"men\" or \"leftists\" or \"martial artists\") aren't homogeneous  categories. While there are overarching trends and patterns characterizing each group, every person is different - when interacting with somebody, you ought to see them as an individual representing their respective group but also, and even more so, as an individual with a unique developmental history. This is my first concrete piece of advice - become mindful of a person, any person, as a person. Don't box them away with \"everything outside of you\" or \"society\" or \"Indians\" or any other such label. Labels, unlike people, aren't living, breathing, moving and changing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn relation to becoming mindful, practice present moment awareness to judge who is or isn't worth approaching or talking to. The \"click\" between people is real, and when it happens you're \"on the same frequency\" - things proceed naturally and joyfully, they \"just happen\". You may or may not believe in a pre-written fate / destiny, but you will agree that every thought and every action subtly maneuvers your life's trajectory, and thus collectively contribute to where you will be. You may say that \"the right person\" will be, for a brief or extended period, walking the same path as you - and as fellow travelers you'll have plenty to share, so you'll gravitate towards each other. \"Forcing it\" for egotistic reasons e.g. to up your \"laycount\" is the worst thing you could do - you'll be wasting your time, energy and emotions, as well as hers. Many books on the subject of mindfulness, I'll recommend Mindfulness in Plain English as authoritative yet minimal - it preserves the essential while discarding the fundamental. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, an excellent way to progressively overcome the ego is to build fundamental Value as a person. Focus on giving instead of receiving - and definitely forget about forcefully snatching. When you have a lot to give, you'll attract people towards you - like misled moths attracted to a source of light. Read books (on anything and everything, use your intuition), do your pushups properly, always be learning, applying, experimenting with life. Pick up a new hobby, start a webdev passion project or set an academic target for yourself. Keep doing, mindfully - and sometimes that'll mean doing nothing, mindfully. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn midst of divergent cultures, changing times, evolving gender roles - what is more specific will turn out to be impermanent. Practice what I've said, you'll find the answers for yourself.\n\nEDIT: moved beyond words at the warm reception, good people"

Empathize with them - make an effort to notice when they're struggling.\n3. Reach out, offer to help and to be there for them, even if they don't ask.\n\nHowever, be mindful not to forget to care for yourself too, to pursue your own goals, to defend your own interests, to lead a fulfilling life. If you aren't striving to better yourself, how can you help others? If you can manage to make only one person in the world happy, and that person is you, that's already a pretty decent result - so long as it wasn't at the expense of others... So that's part of your objective, and you shouldn't become unhappy while helping everybody else.\n\nBut unless you're going through a tough time, you can probably strive for more than that; and that means more than not doing evil: it means learning to be generous, to share your happiness.\n\nEasier said than done -\\_-"

I love this tip because it is a simple way to make sure you can be helpful without being socially awkward! \n\nFor example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, if you say “oh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering” or “you’ve got a huge pimple”, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it’s just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.\n\nHope this helps someone! :)\n\nEDIT: wow, didn’t expect this to take off so fast! So, just for clarity - 20 seconds is a rough guide to indicate a relatively quick and easy fix. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a minute, just use common sense as to what the situation is, if you know the person etc.\n\nAlso, if someone has shit/wet/bled somewhere, or something of that nature, discreetly tell them and offer help to get somewhere to fix themselves up.\n\nBasically, be a decent human being. If you’re close to the person, then you should be able to judge what to say and when based on how you know they will react and process it."

        "content": " \n\n**Everything is Temporary:** \n\nWhen I was in prison, it felt like I would be there forever. That my permanent state of being was uncertainty and pain. I felt as though I would be worthless for the remainder of my life.  Once I looked beyond the fear and anxiety, I understood there was an expiration date. I didn't know when, but I knew there was one. That alone gave me the strength to endure.  This is the power of impermanence.\n\n**Our Perspective Dictates our Reality:**  \n\nIs this happening to you? Is this happening for you? One is playing the victim, the other is taking responsibility for your life. The moment I dropped the victim role (which I played for a while), I found freedom - inside prison. This is our choice.\n\n**Choice is Freedom:** \n\nI found \"Man's Search for Meaning\" in the prison library. It's one of the most profound perspective shifting books I have ever read. I reread it once a year. This quote is one of many reasons I make that claim. \n\n\"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\"\n\nWhen we embrace choice, we have agency over our lives.  When we have agency over our lives - we can rebuild. We can start over. \n\n**Gratitude is a Superpower:** \n\nI was sitting in the prison library, with nothing to my name. I lost everything. My amazing wife, my career, my money, my homes, and cars. I lost my identity and self-worth. And yet, one crisp early morning, the sunrise was spectacular. I put pen to paper and wrote, \"I'm grateful for this morning's sunrise.\" \n\nI found something to be grateful for in my most challenging time. I cannot express how important that truly is. \n\n**Adversity Can Be a Gift:** \n\nOur greatest adversities do not have to be the end. In fact, they can be our greatest teachers and our greatest beginnings. The choice is ours. It begins when we embrace the other 4 lessons."

In the article, you address people who have the symptoms of clinical depression when it comes to their code, and yeah if you're feeling clinically depressed about anything, that's not a project of worth to you.

        "content": "This is a great primer for intros to philosophy of life, death, and meaning. It's a classic. But the conclusion quoted in the OP is seriously flawed. The first half of it is basically right: if there's no overarching, universal, reason to believe anything matters, then it doesn't matter that nothing matters, because in order for that to matter, there would need to be some sort of meta-reason that would make it matter in the same sense (i.e., universally, not just personally). Okay, fine. It doesn't matter that nothing matters.\n\nWe can approach our lives with irony? What? Where did this come from? On what grounds are *we* able to do that? Why would anyone want to do that? How is *this* hypothetical claim about what is apparently possible for *us* to do a solution to nihilism? Sure, maybe it's *possible* that we *can* approach our lives with irony. But not everyone seems to be in a position to do this. In fact, it seems like exactly the sort of thing someone who has been in the ivory tower for decades, making a good living, and only interacting with relatively well-off students, would say. Try telling anyone whose life is suffused with wretchedness that they should try approaching things with irony."

It goes up or down, but it's always there.\n\nTomorrow, the May contracts for crude oil are expiring, so people who own the contract will have to collect 1000 barrels per contract, but speculative buyers have nowhere to hold the oil, and depositories are full, and aren't buying contracts for May anymore.\n\nThis creates a panic selling situation, and the price tanks.\n\nBecause you *have* to collect the oil, there are regulatory concerns for people holding onto the contract. They can't do anything with the oil, and can't sell the contract for any price. That means they have to pay someone to take the worthless contract off their hands.\n\nThis will have effects in the gas prices. Cheaper oil means cheaper gas. And this will affect related oil stocks, like Chevron or Texaco, but these effects will largely be temporary, as the June contracts, while down, are still in positive territory.\n\nThis will not generally affect people's day to day lives at all, unless you work for an oil field that is no considering shutting down."

You are crushing hard, and you're trying to think of a way to make your dream come true.\n\nI see a lot of people around here asking for advice on how to 'confess' to their crush but here's the thing. Having feelings for someone is not a sin! You haven't killed anyone, so why confess?\n\nI get it, you're insecure, you're afraid they won't reciprocate your feelings and you'll be shot down. But if I have learned anything in the 21 years I have been alive is that insecurity will bring you nowhere.\n\nIf you tell someone you have a crush on them out of the blue they'll probably be a little freaked out. So instead, just talk to them! Ask if they want to go do something with you, tell them they look nice, give compliments and smile.\n\nIt's human nature to be attracted to the unknown. Think about this, how do you feel when someone spoils te end of a movie? Exactly, annoyed. You can't enjoy the movie the same way as if you hadn't known  the ending.\n\nSo, in conclusion here's my two-cents:\nIf you like someone, go and talk to them. Ask them about their lives. Show interest and compliment them. Go do something together and just enjoy yourself. \nWorst case scenario you waste an afternoon or evening doing something fun with someone boring.\nBest case scenario they are interested in you and you make some nice memories.\n\nStay strong kings!\n\n-duvall"

        "content": "It's always a balance.\n\nNumber of blades:\n\n* Fewer blades = More efficient shoveling of air because of turbulence (air swirls) created by other blades reduces efficiency. Usually simpler to make.\n* More blades = More stable because the force is spread out over more blades and shovels more air compared to how long the propellers are.\n\nPropeller tips breaking sound barrier is bad (because of lots of turbulence). The longer the propeller the faster the tips go compared to the center. But having too short blades means more loss of energy at the blade tips:\n\n* Longer blades = Better at generating lift, shoveling more air at lower speeds. Longer propellers also less stable and vibrate more.\n* Smaller blades = Allows higher top speeds since the propeller can go much faster without breaking the soundbarrier with the wingtips. More stable.\n\nSo basicly.WW1 airplane: We can't make so good engines. So we're gonna go with efficient short two-bladed propellers because that gives is the most thrust for our weak engines.\n\nWW2 airplane: We gots a lot better engines now. But two-bladed propellers can't shovel enough air to take our planes as fast as we're going to go. So we're going to go with 4 short blades!\n\nHelicopter: We gotta generate lots of lift. So we're going to go with longer and slower rotating blades!\n\nModern helicopter: Uh. Those blades aren't generating enough lift. MORE BLADES! More blades is harder to make, but more stable too.\n\nModern turboprop: Too noisy! We're making special 6 bladed propellers that are much quieter. And computer power and advanced materials allows us to make them special advanced shapes that generate even less noise and more power. So now they look more like ship propellers. But for air! Still kinda short blades because we gotta go fast!\n\nShip propellers: Water dense yo. So we gotta make blades short (or they'll break!) but we make them much wider to shovel a lot of water backwards.\n\nP.S: Jet engines work entirely differently, even if they do have fans at the front they're for compressing air into the engine, not generating thrust.  \n\n\nP.P.S: For ceiling fan. You're moving lots of air, but you want to do it slowly and silently. So lots of wide blades. How long the blades are depends on how mobile you want the fan to be. Big fan = more air silently. Small fan = Noisier, but more mobile."

I think the main difference in wealth accumulated from oil production is mostly due to the fact that absolutely all of the revenue from oil and natural gas is saved in a sovereign wealth fund. In other countries the revenue is instead funnelled directly into government spending, and far less is saved for a rainy day. The Norwegians still use some oil money, but I believe they use only the return from that sovereign wealth fund instead of dipping into the revenue stream directly.\n\nIn addition, I also think that they earn more from natural gas refining than from crude oil, in which statistic they would appear far higher."

        "content": "This may seem like a foreign concept to some of you men who do a lot of cold approaches.  Some men are so aggressive that it's like they're walking around with their dicks in their hands.  I'm not saying you can't be ballsy, but you don't want to look overeager and thirsty with women.\n\nI wrote a post called [**Getting Her Hornier Than You - Getting Laid Takes Patience**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/getting-her-hornier-than-you-getting-laid-takes-patience/), and one thing I would like to point out from it is self-control and delayed gratification leads to the bedroom.  If you play the long game, women are more open to sleeping with you because you had enough time to build  up that desire.  If you make a woman feel those strong feelings of desire for you, she'll get to the point where she feels compelled to sleep with you.\n\nWomen hate men who are at their mercy.  The number one way a woman will have a man at her mercy is dangling sex or the anticipation of sex in front of his face.  If a woman sees you're motivated by sex, she will resent you in a way.  She knows that you lack mental and emotional strength, so she will manipulate you with sex.\n\nWanna know why women are insanely attracted to men with sexual discipline?  Men who are mentally and emotionally strong take care of their business.  When a man can take care of his business (finances, fitness, nutrition, etc) his life improves, and as a by-product, the women in his life also benefit from that.  So if he is not trying to sleep with all these women in the neighborhood, but instead trying to build a successful business as an example, once the business starts spitting out tens of thousands of dollars a month in profits, his life is improved in a major way.\n\nSexual discipline doesn't mean abstinence either.  You could be fucking hot women every week, but you are very sexually disciplined because you aren't controlled by sex.  You know the power of seduction and you know that's it's better to get the woman hornier than you so she can give in to you sexually.\n\nYou may think you'll have to wait for years for her to want to sleep with you, but the less thirsty you are, the more she feels she needs to speed things up.  Don't believe me?  Ask women what she does when she likes a man and he's not pushing up on her.  He's not afraid, it's just that he's not trying to make sexual advances on her.  You may hear her say that she will kinda throw herself at him.  She may hug him a certain way or find an excuse to touch him (grab his arms, play fight with him, or even sit on his lap.\n\nIf you want to have women throwing themselves at you, you need to start being sexually disciplined and practice self-control and delayed gratification."

I did a full day’s worth of abstaining from all activities except walking, thinking, and writing. It was incredibly beneficial and the following days I felt extra focused. However, there are tons of myths about dopamine fasting. Through my own research and experience with the practice I want to dispel these myths so you can approach a dopamine fast the right way. I want to show you in this article what dopamine fasting is, what it isn’t, and what you should **actually** aim to take away from it. Throughout the rest of this article, I’ll fill you in on how I approached the fast, why it was wrong, and how you can take-away the important point of a dopamine fast despite its lack of effect on dopamine. \n\nBefore I dive into this I want to make it clear that I’m not a doctor, medical practitioner, or a behavioural psychology expert. This said, the sources I cite throughout the article are written by experts. I’m aiming to sift through a lot of the noise that exists on the topic of dopamine fasting and provide you with the right mindset and tools to approach fasting that are backed up by these experts. \n\n# ‍The science\n\nI’m going to start off pretty blunt. Dopamine fasting has very little to do with lowering dopamine levels in your brain. The term “dopamine fast” is nothing more than a [sexy marketing name](https://medium.com/@DrSepah/why-the-media-lies-to-you-about-dopamine-fasting-dceed8be007e) that differentiates it from its true nature. In essence, dopamine fasting is a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy technique. If you approach this with an expectation that you’re changing the neurochemical reactions in your brain, you’re going to have a rough time. I’ll tell you why.\n\nIf we look at a study on the effects of dopamine levels in rats following self-administered dopamine binges and a 1 and 7 day deprivation period, we see that the re-introduction of a dopamine inducing activity[ doesn’t produce heightened levels of dopamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702135) in the brain after the deprivation period. Essentially, abstaining from an activity will not reset your dopamine system. This is important to note because a lot of people seem to believe that the dopamine system has tolerance levels that can be manipulated through fasting.\n\nSo, if dopamine fasting isn’t about resetting dopamine levels, what is it about? I briefly mentioned in the introduction to this section that dopamine fasting is actually a form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT is a process of redefining your relationship with your behaviour. Typically it is employed in a structured manner through talking with a therapist in order to address destructive or unproductive behaviours which are the result of [the way people think of their behaviour](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral). CBT encourages you to examine what causes your behaviour based on the classical conditioning model. \n\nThe classical conditioning model is very important to the process of dopamine fasting because it is the framework we use to modify our behaviour. Classical conditioning posits that as humans, our behaviour stems from a stimulant in our environment which, when acted upon, gives us a reward. This reward is what encourages us to repeat the behaviour. What dopamine fasting allows us to do is to redefine our relationship with our behaviour. By abstaining from the action you take (for example, going on Instagram when you're bored at work) you experience what the result is if you don’t act on the impulse. The result of this process is what will change your behaviour. \n\n**Take-aways**\n\n* Dopamine fasting doesn't starve your brain of dopamine\n* There is no reset button on the neurochemical processes that occur in your brain\n* The goal of dopamine fasting is to give you space and time to reflect on what your behaviours do for you\n* Aim to redefine your relationship with your behaviour‍\n\n# My experience\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, I’ll tell you a little bit about my experience with dopamine fasting. Overall it was amazing. The following days I was incredibly focused on getting work done and have truly never been more productive. Even though I approached the fast with the wrong idea about how it works I had one saving grace that made it a good experience. Prior to fasting I had read James Clear’s Atomic Habits. In his book he highlights the habit loop that creates and determines our behaviour. There are 4 stages to the habit loop; cue, craving, response, reward.\n\nI was a classic procrastinator. It took forever to get into deep work and often I never would simply because I didn’t find the work to be incredibly interesting. Everytime I faced a roadblock or got bored, I would go straight to my phone. This happened outside of school work too. Personal projects were always in a state of 20% started. I knew my need for stimulation could be answered by Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, and the likes.  \n\nClear’s book brings up the idea that many different responses can fit in an unproductive habit loop that keeps the cue, craving, and reward. Scrolling through your instagram feed solves the same issue as doing interesting work, it just does it quicker. A key point about human behaviour is that we will always choose the easiest route to solving our discomfort. So, we have a few options: make the reward of productive work quicker (difficult), or make the reward more attractive (easier). By taking the easy route to solving this issue we begin to see why fasting is effective.\n\nWhen you’re fasting, you're bored. But this is very important. When we take the time to really reflect on what it’s like to not be stimulated all the time by constant distractions we realize that boredom is not that bad. In fact, boredom is incredibly important to being productive. Boredom doesn’t make activities more interesting because you have starved yourself of dopamine. Boredom makes activities more interesting because you have re-defined your relationship with the reward. The reward of doing something seems so attractive at that moment, it is only when you experience it that you begin to change your beliefs. Changing your beliefs is at [the crux of CBT](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105305048549). Dopamine fasting, viewed as a CBT technique, gives you the space to identify your beliefs that create your attraction to a reward and allows you to question them. Boredom’s contrast to productivity makes doing something you previously dreaded or avoided much more attractive. \n\nNow, It’s crucial to note that unproductive behaviours are not always unproductive. It’s important that you have a **healthy** relationship with unproductive behaviours. This doesn’t mean avoiding them at all costs. You’re human, you are allowed to relax and watch Netflix occasionally. This process is not meant to stigmatize behaviour, but rather control it. What’s most important is that you have autonomy over your behaviour. If you’re going to scroll through social media, set a time to do it and satisfy your immediate craving with a more productive behaviour at the time. One of the best things about dopamine fasting is that you get to practice saying “this can wait”. \n\nThe last thing I did during the fast was to think of ways to make getting distracted hard. Now that I had realized how attractive the reward of productive work was, I wanted to make it even easier to do in contrast to other behaviours. By making the unproductive responses to similar rewards difficult to do, it makes the productive response that much easier. For me, Infotainment (YouTube, random articles, reddit, etc..) and social media were the biggest competitors for doing productive work. With this in mind, I leveraged technology to block targeted sites for periods of time that I wanted to get work done and blocked all non-essential apps on my phone as well as putting it in a different room while I worked. \n\nA dopamine fast is not a magic pill or a one-time practice. You will experience a heightened focus the next day or two, but this will taper off. Personally I plan on doing a dopamine fast once a month in order to reevaluate my relationship with my behaviours. The process of redefining your relationship with your unproductive behaviours takes time and conscious practice. I suggest mapping out your behaviour while you’re fasting so that you have something to reference in the following days. This way you will be able to reference your strategy to avoid these behaviours when you want to be productive. \n\nTo end my experience on a final note, I want to make one thing clear. No amount of reading or researching about ways to be more productive will help unless you directly experience what it is like to be bored. Taking a cold shower in the morning, setting site blockers on its own, and whatever productivity “hacks” you do will not affect your behaviour unless you change the habit loop. By directly experiencing the effect of not engaging in behaviour meant to distract you, you experience what boredom is like. Use this experience to re-define how you value the rewards of your behaviours. This is why I recommend you do a dopamine fast, and approach it in the right way. \n\n**Take-aways**\n\n* Boredom is a powerful teacher that will change how you value rewards of behaviours\n* Practice saying “this can wait” every time you have a craving\n* To get an extra 20% out of your efforts, think of ways make bad habits more difficult\n* Simply reading about this will not make a change, you need to experience it\n\n# How to dopamine fast\n\nNow that we know what dopamine fasting is (and isn’t) as well as what you should aim to take away from it, let’s start planning for it. There is a lot of misguidance of individual’s accounts of their dopamine fasts where they avoid everything except walking, meditating, and writing. Dopamine fasting isn’t that strict. What’s more important is that you limit unproductive behaviours. If you want to talk to people, talk to people. If you want to build a website, build a website. The point is to become introspective of how you feel when a craving appears and your typical response is an unproductive behaviour. I suggest using the habit model from Atomic Habits to identify your unproductive behaviours ahead of time\n\nA practise that is very common and essential to productive CBT is questioning your beliefs. When planning your day, make sure to make ample time for reflection. And before you ask, the reflection does not necessarily need to be structured, but it must aim to question your beliefs and motivations behind your unproductive behaviours. The socratic method of questioning [yields the most information ](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/science/article/pii/S0005796715000790?via%3Dihub)and leads to more noticeable behavioural change in CBT techniques. Here is a great example of [how to practice the socratic method](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/program/education/us/en/documents/project-design/strategies/dep-question-socratic.pdf). Personally I suggest limiting the number of things you do in a day to dedicate your effort towards reflection. Here is what my schedule looked like on my fast:\n\n 8:30 AM - Wake up, shower, make coffee\n\n 9:00 AM - Journal about what you’re looking forwards to learning\n\n 9:30 AM - Meditate\n\n10:20 AM - Go for a long walk, no music/podcasts\n\n12:30 PM - Sit on the balcony with a notepad, write anything that comes to mind\n\n 3:30 PM - Meditate\n\n 4:00 PM - Do the dishes, take-out garbage\n\n 5:30 PM - Chat with my girlfriend while eating dinner\n\n 7:00 PM - Make a plan of what you want to do over the next 2 days\n\n 8:00 PM - Watch Netflix \n\n 9:00 PM - Go to bed\n\nNow, when you're participating in your fast you want to spend time productively acknowledging your unproductive behaviours. Every time you feel a craving to use your phone, watch Netflix, or whichever behaviour you’re trying to control, do this process: say “it can wait”, write it down, and schedule a specific time to do it in the following days. This is the core process behind developing control over your behaviour. Like I mentioned before, unproductive behaviour isn’t 100% unproductive. What matters most is that you decide when you want to do it. \n\nLastly, and most importantly, pick a time to fast that hopefully has nice weather and doesn’t impact your life too much. I did my fast on a Monday instead of the weekend since I didn’t want to selfishly take the time I spend with my partner on the weekend. If you’re a busy person, don’t feel like you need to dedicate a full 24 hours to this. Plan an afternoon where you can be free to do this and practice the techniques in a condensed period. \n\n**Take-aways**\n\n* Map out unproductive behaviours\n* Write down all your cravings and schedule a time to do them in the following days\n* When you’re reflecting, dig deep into your beliefs using the socratic method \n* Reasonably limit the activities you do during the dopamine fast\n* Plan your fast for a time that fits your lifestyle and hopefully has nice weather\n\n## What next? \n\nIf you approached dopamine fasting with skepticism or questions, I hope this article helped guide you and brought clarity to the practice. The next step is to participate in a dopamine fast yourself. For your convenience, I’ve summarized all the major action points in a pdf for you to reference and help guide your fast. \n\n‍\n\nYou can download the dopamine fasting cheat sheet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_-l096AyahBVdqVxznEqacoCn-D6c4_v/view?usp=sharing)"

        "content": "Answer: The WHO is the UN's medical team essentially. They are supposed to help battle epidemics among other things around the world. When it was conceived in 1948, it was thought to be in the best interest of the planet to have an organization who can help on a global level. They have handled things like the ebola outbreaks and generally assist more countries which don't have the resources to handle outbreaks. In case of a global catastrophic event, they would help coordinate a global response. Needless to say, this is pretty much the first time that has happened since its inception at this scale.   \n\nIf you download the [PDF from the WHO's website](https://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/assessed-contributions/en/), you can see exact contributions. It looks like their budget is done every 3 months and the US paid roughly around 60 million per quarter of its 250m dollar budget. Looking at the numbers for 2020 Mar 31 and 2019 Dec 31, it looks to be consistent so its about 240m per year of a 1 billion USD budget, or 24%. I've seen varying numbers as little at 15% and as high as 25% but I am using the WHOs own website and budget PDFs. The important thing is not that the exact number but to know that the US is the largest contributor and obviously, pulling out causes a big disruption to the flow of cash.   \n\nDo we get 240m worth in return? That is the big question that has wider reaching facets in the answer. It is difficult to answer this without bias. For starters, to answer back with a question, are we looking to get something back from it? In some people's eyes, the WHO is goodwill for those less fortunate who otherwise would be extremely devastated. Next, it is hard to calculate benefit when it comes from secondary prevention of a pandemic. For example, we don't know how much we benefited from say, a stopping of ebola in Africa and preventing it from spreading to other countries like the US. However, it should be noted that the concept of global organizations (like the UN, NATO, etc) having the US as a big contributor without reaping a proportional amount of benefits or without other countries paying their proportional amount is an argument that has been debated way longer than Trump has been in office. The whether or not this is worth it is up to you to decide.    \n\nThe bigger issue is that the WHO is supposed to be neutral and effective in a situation like this. However, to many (reaching outside of the US as well), the WHO has been suspiciously [cozy with the Chinese narrative of events](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/world-health-organization-blame-pandemic-coronavirus/609820/). It should be noted that South Korea and other regional countries questioned the Chinese story of events long before the US was even on pandemic mode, so this isn't just the US making these claims. Note that this perceived favoritism is nothing new for these big global organizations and is often more of a nuisance than a serious problem. However, the claim by the US is that in this case, it caused serious issues if the WHO is in fact deliberately just following Chinese orders as is the claim."

        "content": "Not OP but I can answer. Super simplified version is that modern digital cameras use itty bitty light sensitive photocells that make up a grid. This is called the sensor. Light hits the sensor and these photocells record how much light hits each one (which corresponds to a pixel in a digital image). This gets translated into an image.\n\nA super basic black and white camera would need one sensor, and use either a 0 or 1 to to record black or white pixels. You would move on from there to use, say, a number from 1-4 for each pixel, so you could get half-tones at the expense of more space needed to save a pixel.\n\nFor reference, modern cameras can have red, green, and blue color sensors that store each pixel at a 10-bit depth, which means each red, green, and blue pixel can store a number from 1-1024 representing its color value. That’s a lot of data! These 3 values get blended together to make an individual final pixel which makes up the final image. \n\nA 12 megapixel camera has 12.7 million pixels to save per image. And modern smartphones can do all this math in less than a second. It’s incredible.\n\nVideos are done in the exact same way, but shot in 24-60 images per second. Only recently have phones been able to shoot high resolution and high frame rate because the processing power needed is incredibly high.\n\nI hope that answers your question!"

        "content": "Basically lots of electrical signals turning little switches on and off. \n\nThe electrical signals are called bits, and are represented by a 1 or a 0. A 1 basically means a wire is powered, and a 0 means its not. \n\nTransistors are the switches. They take one input, and allow electricity to flow through depending on the value of the input. Some transistors allow power through when the input is powered, or 1, and some allow power through when the input is off, or 0. There’s a lot more behind transistors but that’s pretty much the basics.\n\nLogic gates are made of a bunch of transistors connected together. Logic gates are the basic building block of components that compute things, like the processor. Logic gates take one or more input and produce one output. One example would be an AND gate, which takes two inputs, and if they are both 1s (powered), it will output a 1 (powered). If one or both inputs are turned off, the AND gate will output a 0 (off). There are other logic gates like OR gates, which output a 1 if one or both inputs are 1s, or a NOT gate, which outputs the opposite of the input 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 0.\n\nThe processor, or CPUs job is to execute the instructions provided to it, this could be something like take 2 numbers from the memory (RAM), add them, and store them in a new spot in the RAM, or get a value from memory, and tell the motherboard to output the value out of the USB port. The instructions are really just a lot of 1s and 0s that turn on or off certain things in the processor.\n\nA computer has multiple places it can store things. The first and fastest is to store data in the CPUs cache, which is extremely fast, but also extremely small, and it resets when you restart. Cache is used to store some instructions or numbers the CPU is going to use for calculations. The RAM, which is the memory, is much larger than the cache, but a little bit slower, the computer stores all values for running programs and important numbers here, for example playing a game, it would store your players position and data here, for quick access for the CPU. This also resets on restart. The largest, and slowest method of storage is the disk, this is where all of your files live, and it keeps its data even when the computer restarts. Two types of disk storage are SSD or HDD, Solid state drive or Hard disk drive. SSDs use transistor trickery to store data permanently with no moving parts, and HDDs do magnet stuff with a spinning disk and moving arm. \n\nThe GPU (Graphics processing unit) creates the output that you see on your screen. It does this using data sent to it from the CPU, and renders it, producing a video output. The CPU is very good at doing a few very hard tasks at once, while the GPU is made for doing thousands of tiny tasks at one time. The GPU is the most important part for gamers, as it is the part that processes the graphics in games. All computers have some type of GPU, either using one built into the CPU, or using a discreet GPU, like in gaming PCs. The way GPUs work gets very in depth, so that’s the idea to know.\n\nThe motherboard connects all of the parts, like the CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and it deals with IO. IO stands for input output. Everything is connected using busses, which are just groups of wires that transmit data. The chipset is basically a translator between the CPU and the rest of the system, it is made of two parts, the north bridge and the south bridge. The CPU connects to the north bridge using the frontside bus, then the north bridge communicates with the RAM using the memory bus, and the GPU using the PCIe or depending on the system AGP bus. The south bridge handles lower speed communication like PCI devices, and it handles all IO like USB (universal serial bus), Ethernet, SATA (connection to storage disk). It also connects to the ROM, read only memory, which is used to boot the computer. The north bridge and south bridge are connected using the internal bus.\n\nThat explanation was a little in depth at times but if you can understand it, great.\n\nTL;DR:\nLots of wires and switches.\n\nEdit:\nThis post did a lot better than I expected, and people seemed to really like my explanation. I'm considering starting a youtube channel where I explain computer stuff like this, and I was wondering if anyone would watch it.\n\nEdit 2:\nHere's a link to the channel I made quickly I still don't really know what to name it, I'll post videos soon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsbzvawdQPWSBHNG1LZK5Fw"

        "content": "I'm not a battery expert, but I'll take a stab.\n\nIt's not true that one terminal of a battery has excess electrons, while the other terminal has a deficit of electrons. They are both charge neutral. \n\nBatteries have an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte. As the battery is discharged to power something, not only do electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, positively-charged ions flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. The electrons and ions reunite at the cathode.\n\nIt takes energy to charge up a battery, and we get energy out when it discharges, because the ions and electrons are more chemically stable at the cathode.\n\nIn a lithium-ion battery, the kind I'm most familiar with, the anode is unusually graphite. The cathode is a lithium metal oxide. In the charged up state, the lithium atoms are stored in the layers of graphite. They aren't very happy about that, and would prefer to go home to the lithium metal oxide at the cathode. When the anode and cathode are connected through an external circuit, lithium atoms are ionized. The electrons go through the circuit, and the lithium ions diffuse through the electrolyte, and they are reunited at the cathode.\n\nWhen you just connect two batteries together, positive to negative, nothing happens because the anode and the cathode are charge neutral. For electrons to be exchanged, there would have to be a channel for ions to be exchanged, too, and there's not."

        "content": "# Sommaire\n\n[Chapitre 1 : Les indices](https://www.reddit.com/r/vosfinances/comments/fvgs12/les_etf_en_long_et_en_large_chapitre_1_les_indices/)\n\nChapitre 2 : Les ETF à réplication physique et synthétique\n\nChapitre 3 : Les ETF obligataires, sur contrats à terme et à effet de levier\n\nChapitre 4 : Les risques - la liquidité, le tracking error, les coûts et comment choisir un ETF\n\nChapitre 5 : Construction d'un portefeuille d'ETF et exemples de stratégies.\n\n# Introduction\n\nDans ce chapitre de ma série, je vais enfin parler des Exchange Traded Funds (ETF, fonds cotés en bourse). Avant cela, il faut que j’explique comment fonctionnent les marchés financiers pour que vous compreniez les mécanismes principaux de façon simplifiée (je n’irai pas profondément dans les détails, juste ce qui est nécessaire pour comprendre le sujet). Ensuite je parlerai rapidement des fonds indiciels non cotés et je viendrai au sujet principal, les ETF. Je distinguerai les deux méthodes principales de réplication ainsi que les variantes et les nuances. En dernier lieu j’aborderai les ramifications systémiques des ETF. Je pars du principe que je parle à quelqu’un qui a une vague idée de comment fonctionne la finance de marché et je me limiterai aux marchés d’actions, je risque de lancer beaucoup de termes et je vous invite à me poser des questions dessus ou à creuser vous-mêmes. Je préviens d’emblée que je ne dirai pas tout ce qu’il y a dire sur les risques des ETF dans ce post et que le quatrième chapitre complètera toutes les informations qui manqueront dans celui-ci.\n\n# Marchés primaires et marchés secondaires d’actions\n\nAfin de comprendre vraiment la différence entre un fonds d’investissement classique et un ETF, je pense qu’il est nécessaire d’avoir à l’esprit le fonctionnement des bourses d’actions.\n\nPour rappel, une entreprise a deux sources principales de financement long-terme, les capitaux propres appartenant aux actionnaires et la dette financière. Les actionnaires ont un contrôle sur les revenus générés par l’entreprise après que toutes les charges sont imputées (le résultat net) et les éventuelles recettes de la liquidation de l’entreprise une fois tous les créanciers remboursés (fournisseurs, administration fiscale, personnel, banques, détenteurs d’obligations…). Ils peuvent aussi voter lors des conseils d’administration pour par exemple choisir les directeurs ou bien se verser un dividende si l’entreprise a la trésorerie qu’il faut et si l’entreprise a généré plus de bénéfices résiduels que de pertes depuis sa création. Tous les bénéfices résiduels qu’ils ne se versent pas en dividende sont réinvestis dans l’entreprise. Une action est une fraction de ce droit et les entreprises peuvent en avoir des milliers ou des milliards.\n\nLe marché primaire des actions est le marché où les entreprises cherchent à se financer en créant ex nihilo de nouvelles actions, qu’elles vont vendre pour lever des fonds, ce qu’on appelle une émission d’actions. Pour les entreprises non cotées, les émissions d’actions se négocient la plupart du temps au gré-à-gré entre particuliers ou bien avec des fonds de capital investissement (j’ai écrit un post à ce sujet). Pour les entreprises cotées ou sur le point d’être cotées (IPO), cela se fait avec des ventes aux enchères, et en fonction de la quantité de capital engagé par les participants de l’enchère, chaque participant repart avec un certain nombre d’actions à un prix qui reflète l’offre et la demande. Investir sur le marché primaire c’est directement investir dans le capital de l’entreprise.\n\nLe marché secondaire permet à quelqu’un qui n’a pas participé à ces enchères d’acheter les actions de l’entreprise et à un actionnaire existant de revendre ses actions sans que l’entreprise soit directement impliquée. Il y a différentes manières d’organiser un marché secondaire, mais il est par exemple possible pour une banque d’animer un marché (market making), c’est-à-dire de faire en sorte que ses clients puissent acheter ou vendre des actions instantanément. La banque détient d’un côté des liquidités et de l’autre des actions d’entreprises et propose d’acheter des actions à un prix (le **bid**) ou de vendre des actions à un prix un peu plus élevé (l’**ask**), plus la différence entre les deux est grande, plus la banque gagne de l’argent quand des participants achètent ou vendent des actions. Les participants de ces marchés exécutent des **ordres au marché**, c’est-à-dire qu’ils spécifient seulement le nombre d’actions qu’ils veulent acheter ou vendre, c’est l’animateur de marché qui fixe les prix. L’avantage de ce marché est qu’il peut fonctionner à n’importe quel moment de la journée et de la semaine, mais il est relativement opaque.\n\nUne autre façon de structurer un marché secondaire c’est de le diriger par les ordres des participants, c’est-à-dire que des acheteurs et des vendeurs proposent continuellement des prix d’achat et de vente. Les participants font des **ordres à cours limité**, c’est-à-dire qu’ils font des ordres où les acheteurs spécifient le prix maximal qu’ils sont prêts à payer pour un certain nombre d’actions et les vendeurs le prix minimal auquel ils veulent vendre leurs actions, les vendeurs et les acheteurs qui feront les meilleurs prix seront les premiers servis. Ce genre d’enchère offre de la transparence mais fonctionne surtout en rassemblant assez d’acheteurs et de vendeurs en même temps, d’où l’intérêt d’avoir des heures d’ouverture et de fermeture pour les marchés dirigés par des ordres.\n\nLes bourses contemporaines fusionnent ces deux systèmes pour maximiser la liquidité des actions, c’est-à-dire la facilité et la rapidité avec laquelle on peut acheter ou vendre des actions au meilleur prix et ainsi des gros acteurs font de l’animation de marché en bourse. Dans ce genre de système, acheter ou vendre de grosses quantités d’actions avec un ordre au marché influence les prix, ce que je vais illustrer avec un exemple simple. Imaginons une action où il y a 3 ordres d’achat et de vente à cours limité et que je cherche à acheter 100 actions avec un ordre au marché. Je vais recevoir les 100 actions les moins chères en vente actuellement avec un prix légèrement supérieur à l’ask (ici 102,5 euros par action). Cela va déplacer l’ask vers le haut et le prix de l’action augmentera aussi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Le marché avant et après l'ordre au marché, le prix passe de 100 à 102](https://preview.redd.it/dghff1pajzr41.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a18c4b2e1fd9d02b8a1044df80b3c67eb83249)\n\nPour résumer il faut donc comprendre la distinction entre marché primaire et secondaire, la notion d’animation de marché et de marché dirigé par des ordres et enfin l’effet sur les prix qu’ont les ordres au marché, ces concepts prendront tout leur sens quand je parlerai des risques et des coûts liés aux ETF dans le quatrième chapitre.\n\n# Les fonds communs de placement, les fonds indiciels non cotés\n\nAvant de parler des fonds indiciels cotés, je vais parler de ceux qui ne le sont pas pour que vous puissiez comprendre la différence.\n\nTraditionnellement, pour répliquer un indice boursier, on utiliserait, entre autres, un type de fonds d’investissement appelé fonds commun de placement (FCP ou Mutual Fund en anglais), qui a pour particularité de donner aux détenteurs de ses actions un statut de copropriétaire des actifs détenus par le fonds. Il est géré par une société de gestion qui elle-même n’est pas propriétaire des actifs, ce qui diffère d’une société d’investissement à capital variable (SICAV) où les détenteurs des actions du fonds sont actionnaires, votent au conseil d’administration et ne détiennent pas les actifs. Cela veut dire que si la société de gestion disparaît, les détenteurs de parts du fonds peuvent récupérer leur argent sans que la société puisse se servir de leurs actifs pour éponger ses propres dettes. Soit dit en passant, les FCP et les SICAV sont deux types d’OPCVM (Open-end fund en anglais).\n\nCe qu’on appelle la valeur liquidative (Net Asset Value, NAV) d’une part de FCP est la valeur théorique d’une part du fonds. Quand un nouvel investisseur veut investir dans un FCP qui n’est pas coté, le FCP créera de nouvelles actions et les échangera contre le cash de l’investisseur en fonction de la NAV du jour. Si l’investisseur sort du fonds, alors ses parts seront détruites et l’investisseur récupérera une somme équivalente à la NAV de ses parts le jour de la vente. L’avantage de ce système est qu’il est facile (en théorie) pour un investisseur de rentrer et de sortir du fonds, sans avoir à passer par un marché secondaire, tout se fait sur le marché primaire avec la société de gestion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Equation de la valeur liquidative](https://preview.redd.it/btb15ygzjzr41.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3515692d3fe9b587ac77ee0d249a66de66dfd2e)\n\nLe gros problème de ce système est que le fonds doit avoir à disposition assez de liquidités tous les jours pour pouvoir rembourser les investisseurs qui veulent sortir, et le fonds doit acheter et vendre lui-même les actions en bourse en fonction des entrées et des sorties, ce qui engendre des frais de transaction et des impôts sur les plus-values. Cela diminue conséquemment la rentabilité du fonds, ce qui se transforme probablement en des frais non-négligeables pour les investisseurs, soit sur les encours, soit à l’entrée ou à la sortie du fonds.\n\n[Seulement une partie de l'argent investi sert à acheter des paniers de l'indice dans le modèle non-coté](https://preview.redd.it/xh35ycn6kzr41.jpg?width=2723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb7ffa12fd83cceb5ae8fc48ad887d41b610826f)\n\n# Les ETF à réplication physique\n\nLes ETF à réplication physique fonctionnent essentiellement sur le principe qu’au lieu de créer des parts contre du cash et ensuite investir une partie du cash dans l’indice comme le font les fonds indiciels non cotés, ils créent des parts uniquement quand on leur délivre un panier d’actions correspondant à l’indice qu’ils suivent, ce qu’on appelle un « creation unit ». Cet acte se nomme « souscription » en français. Ces paniers contiennent généralement des dizaines de milliers d’actions de l’indice et sont échangeables contre des dizaines de milliers de parts de l’ETF. Une société de gestion qui crée un ETF doit donc trouver des animateurs de marché (souvent des banques d’investissement) avec assez de capital pour pouvoir constituer ces paniers tous les jours et les revendre à des investisseurs intéressés par l’indice suivi, on appelle ces animateurs de marché les participants autorisés (AP).\n\nUne analogie est que l’ETF est un commerçant de gros et les AP sont à la fois les fournisseurs de l’ETF et ses détaillants. Si un AP a assez de clients qui veulent acheter des parts de l’ETF, il va constituer un panier, l’échanger contre quelques milliers de parts de l’ETF et revendre les parts à ses clients. L’opération inverse existe aussi, on l’appelle « redemption » ou « rachat » en français et elle consiste à rassembler assez de parts de l’ETF pour pouvoir récupérer un panier qui correspond à l’indice, panier qui s’appelle alors « redemption basket ». Ainsi, si l’AP a assez de clients qui vendent leurs parts de l’ETF, il va rassembler les parts provenant de ses clients et s’en servir pour racheter un panier d’actions de l’indice. Les AP peuvent faire ces opérations seulement à des moments précis de la journée et il faut souligner qu’en Europe les ETF à réplication physique préfèrent prendre du cash aux AP plutôt que des paniers d’actions et acheter les actions eux-mêmes et font payer un supplément aux AP pour les frais de transaction.\n\nComme le nom l’indique, l’ETF est lui-même coté en bourse, ce qui permet entre autres de mettre en compétition plusieurs AP pour que les investisseurs puissent acheter et vendre leurs parts au juste prix, en plus des AP, d’autres acteurs institutionnels n’ayant pas le droit de faire des souscriptions ou des rachats peuvent faire de l’animation de marché pour l’ETF. Sans aucun AP, rien n’empêcherait que le prix des parts de l’ETF puisse dévier de la NAV (la valeur de l’indice dans notre cas) au gré de la demande des investisseurs, vu que l’ETF est coté en bourse, mais le processus de « creation/redemption » (souscription/rachat) donne une incitation financière aux AP de faire en sorte que l’ETF suive l’indice.\n\nSi par exemple plein d’acheteurs font des ordres au marché sur l’ETF, et que le prix de son action dépasse la NAV, on dit que l’ETF se vend à « premium » par rapport à l’indice. Mettons-nous dans une situation imaginaire où la NAV est à 100 euros et le prix d’une part du fonds est à 102 euros. Imaginons qu’un AP estime qu’en vendant 50 000 parts de l’ETF (qui correspondent à un panier de l’indice) le prix de l’ETF va redescendre à la NAV, il va donc emprunter ces 50 000 parts de l’ETF à une banque ou un fonds, les vendre immédiatement pour plus ou moins 102 euros l’unité et racheter un panier avec ce cash pour environ 5 millions d’euros. Cela va faire redescendre le prix de l’ETF à la NAV. A la fin de la journée il va pouvoir échanger son panier contre 50 000 parts, qu’il va rendre à la banque ou au fonds auquel il les a empruntés. Il réalise donc un profit de (102 – 100) \\* 50 000 = 100 000 euros (sans compter les frais de transaction, l’impact sur les prix, la liquidité et le coût de l’emprunt de titre).\n\nSi le prix de l’ETF est en-dessous de la NAV, on dit que l’ETF est à un « discount » et l’AP fera la transaction inverse pour que le prix remonte à la NAV. On appelle ce genre d’opération un arbitrage et les AP ont intérêt égoïste à attendre le plus longtemps possible pour corriger le prix, car cela a un coût et des risques pour eux, les mettre en compétition sert donc à les obliger à réaliser ces opérations plus régulièrement. En faisant ces opérations les AP influent directement sur l’indice et font que le prix de l’ETF le suive.\n\nCette opération de « creation/redemption » a un intérêt d’un point de vue fiscal car quand l’ETF crée des parts et reçoit un panier, il inscrit dans ses comptes la valeur à laquelle il a obtenu ces parts, ce qui va constituer son prix de revient unitaire (PRU) que regarde l’administration fiscale. Si un AP vient rendre un panier, l’ETF va lui rendre les actions avec le plus faible PRU de son inventaire, ce qui veut dire que si l’ETF est obligé de vendre des actions, son PRU partira de plus haut donc les plus-values seront moins taxées par l’administration fiscale. Par ailleurs vous noterez qu’en temps normal l’ETF n’est pas obligé de vendre des actions en fonction des entrées et des sorties, vu qu’il rend les paniers aux AP, ce sont les AP qui endossent les coûts de transaction et l’ETF n’a pas à détenir de liquidités qui pèseraient sur sa rentabilité.\n\nLe dernier élément crucial pour comprendre un ETF à réplication physique est le prêt de titre. Comme l’ETF a en général la capacité de conserver des actions pour très longtemps et qu’elles ne servent pas à grand-chose à l’intérieur de l’ETF, la société de gestion va prêter temporairement des titres à des vendeurs à découvert, qui parient sur la baisse des cours des actions détenues par l’ETF. En général, un ETF peut prêter au plus la moitié de ses actions à la fois et typiquement ça se situe à peu près 20% des actions du fonds à un moment donné. Ces prêts de titres sont complètement garantis par des actions ou des obligations liquides ou du cash en collatéral et l’ETF reçoit une commission pour le risque qu'il prend.\n\n[Schéma complet, il faut cependant noter que les AP ne sont pas les seuls animateurs de marché et qu'ils ne se procurent pas forcément les actions en bourse](https://preview.redd.it/u7dq7fvpkzr41.jpg?width=2973&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c99676020067d020a5e07286acdac8ca9b9ea283)\n\nLe prêt de titre peut introduire du risque de contrepartie, c’est-à-dire un risque de perte de NAV de l’ETF qui ne serait pas lié à l’indice sous-jacent, si deux choses se produisent en même temps. Si le collatéral perd de la valeur et si le vendeur à découvert ne peut pas rendre les actions qu’il a emprunté, alors l’ETF perdrait de la NAV. Le prêt de titre permet à l’ETF de diminuer drastiquement ses frais de gestion voire même dégager des bénéfices supplémentaires si les actions du fonds sont très demandées par les vendeurs à découvert. Des chercheurs ont montré que certains gestionnaires d’ETF surpondéraient les actions les plus demandées par les vendeurs à découvert par rapport aux indices suivis, ou pouvaient les prêter à prix cassé à leurs sociétés mères, ce qui indique qu’il y a un possible conflit d’intérêt entre les gestionnaires et les détenteurs de parts des ETF à réplication physique.\n\nCertains gestionnaires d’ETF préfèrent ne pas répliquer l’indice intégralement car certaines actions qui les constituent ont une part trop petite de l’indice pour que leur inclusion soit significative. Certains gestionnaires vont également décider d’exclure ou de sous-pondérer les actions qui peuvent être coûteuses à se procurer, si la différence entre leur bid et leur ask est grande, on dit que ces ETF font de la réplication échantillonnée. Certains gestionnaires vont aller encore plus loin et introduire de la gestion active et surpondérer ou sous-pondérer certaines entreprises en fonction des prévisions de leurs analystes voire carrément (pour une minorité d’entre eux) introduire des produits dérivés à effet de levier certains jours s’ils pensent que le prix d’une entreprise va grandement fluctuer, afin de pouvoir spéculer dessus. Ces ETF à gestion active ont souvent des frais d’analystes en plus et prennent des frais sur encours supérieurs, et sont naturellement plus risqués.\n\n# Les ETF à réplication synthétique\n\nL’autre grande catégorie d’ETF sont les ETF à réplication synthétique. L’idée derrière ces ETF est qu’au lieu de demander à des AP d’apporter les actions de l’indice, on leur demande d’apporter directement du cash à l’ETF, que ce dernier utilisera pour acheter des paniers d’actions liquides auprès d’une banque d’investissement. Par-dessus cela, la banque d’investissement versera les éventuelles plus-values et dividendes de l’indice que l’on cherche à répliquer à intervalles réguliers, tandis que l’ETF versera les plus-values et dividendes des actions qu’il a acheté auprès de la banque partenaire avec une commission supplémentaire appelée « swap spread ». Le gros avantage de cette méthode est que les AP ne doivent plus s’embêter à acheter ou vendre à découvert des paniers et quand ils ont envie de faire un arbitrage entre la NAV du fonds et le prix de l’ETF, ils vont tout simplement apporter ou retirer du cash auprès de l’ETF contre des parts, ce qui a pour avantage de faire en sorte que les ETF suivent beaucoup mieux leur NAV, en moyenne 5 fois plus précisément que les ETF à réplication physique. Il est à noter que parfois les ETF préfèrent conserver le cash des AP, plutôt que d’acheter le panier de collatéral à la banque partenaire, et faire comme s’ils détenaient ces paniers.\n\nOn appelle le fait d’échanger les plus-values et dividendes d’un panier d’actions contre un autre un « Total Return Swap » (TRS) et les ETF qui suivent ce modèle sont dits « unfunded ». Pour illustrer comment cela fonctionne, imaginons que j’ai 10 actions de Total SA qui valent 30 euros l’unité et que je rentre dans un TRS avec mon ami qui lui détient une part de LVMH à 300 euros. On décide que tous les 3 mois on s’échangera nos rendements et que je dois un swap-spread de 4% par an. 3 mois plus tard, Total verse un dividende de 1 euro par action et l’action vaut maintenant 30,50 euros. LVMH n’a pas versé de dividende et vaut 295 euros. Je dois donc (plus-value + dividende) \\* nombre d’actions + swap spread à mon ami, à savoir (0,5 + 1) \\* 10 + 300 \\* 4% \\* 3/12 = 18 euros. J’ai fait 300 \\* 4% \\* 3/12 car je paye uniquement la commission du trimestre, sur la valeur de départ du swap. Mon ami me doit -5 euros vu que LVMH a fait une moins-value, donc au total je dois à mon ami 23 euros. Ainsi, tant que mon ami et moi sommes solvables, c’est comme si je détenais une action LVMH et lui détenait 10 actions de Total grâce à ce swap.\n\n[Schéma du TRS, dans le processus de rachat, les AP récupèrent du cash au lieu de paniers de l'indice](https://preview.redd.it/veirg8oalzr41.jpg?width=2426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f3f89585530a3d76b2f7c64e5f22f4a2372debf)\n\nUne variante d’ETF synthétiques sont les modèles « funded », qui ne fonctionnent pas vraiment avec un swap. Dans ce modèle, les AP donnent aussi du cash à l’ETF contre de nouvelles parts, et l’ETF s’en sert pour acheter des billets structurés à capital non garanti à la banque partenaire, qui va quant à elle déposer du collatéral dans un compte chez une tierce partie. Un billet structuré est un type de titre hybride qui au lieu de verser un coupon, verse le rendement d’un indice, à savoir dans notre cas de les plus-values et dividendes de l’indice que l’on cherche à répliquer. Si les AP viennent rendre des parts, l’ETF récupère du cash à partir du collatéral chez la tierce partie et le donne aux AP. Si la banque fait faillite, en théorie, la tierce partie devrait donner tout le collatéral à l’ETF. Il faut cependant faire très attention à ce que l’ETF n’ait pas à faire de démarches judiciaires pour récupérer le collatéral en cas de défaut de la contrepartie. Ces modèles ont tendance à être assez opaques et je ne les recommanderais pas, personnellement, si vous craigniez le risque de contrepartie.\n\n[Modèle funded en simplifié, en résumé, c'est comme acheter de la dette structurée à une banque avec une garantie](https://preview.redd.it/h5nsupbmlzr41.jpg?width=2615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d326e4591e123dfdddbb4a77d41c838e5c08eb9d)\n\nUne grosse critique qui est formulée à l’encontre des banques d’investissement qui pratiquent des swaps avec des ETF est qu’elles se servent de ces ETF pour se débarrasser les actifs qui sont contraignants pour elles en les vendant comme collatéral. Les accords de Bâle ont introduit des contraintes sur les capitaux des banques : pour faire simple, si une banque détient un actif risqué, elle doit aussi détenir du capital de bonne qualité comme des obligations d’Etat pour compenser. Cette hypothèse n’est pas contredite par la recherche. Par ailleurs, les swaps introduisent un certain risque de contrepartie pour les détenteurs des parts de l’ETF si la banque d’investissement fait faillite et qu’en même temps le panier d’actions que détient l’ETF en collatéral perd de la valeur par rapport à l’indice que l’on cherche à répliquer. Une autre critique est que les sociétés de gestion des ETF en Europe tendent à faire des swaps avec les banques dont elles sont les filiales, ce qui est interdit aux Etats-Unis. Elles le justifient en citant des swap spreads moins importants, entre autres.\n\n# Détails généraux\n\nA la fois pour les ETF à réplication physique et les ETF à réplication synthétique, la question du collatéral est importante car elle détermine l’exposition au risque de contrepartie. Ce que montre la recherche est que ces deux catégories d’ETF ont tendance à être surcollatéralisées d’environ 8-10% en moyenne, ce qui veut dire qu’en cas de défaut des contreparties, que ce soient les vendeurs à découvert ou bien les partenaires de swap, la NAV ne pourrait pas perdre de la valeur dans ce cas de figure. Bien sûr, en fonction du collatéral, cela peut changer à tout moment et dans l’idéal le collatéral devrait être fortement corrélé avec l’indice suivi car si la contrepartie fait défaut, alors notre collatéral ne devrait pas avoir une NAV trop différente de l’indice que l’on suit. Si l’on a envie de vraiment pousser l’analyse d’un ETF très loin on cherchera le degré de corrélation entre le collatéral et l’indice. Le degré de risque de contrepartie est quand-même naturellement plus élevé pour les ETF synthétiques, car le collatéral représente toute la valeur du fonds, tandis que pour un ETF physique cela ne dépasse pas la moitié du fonds. Dans le pire des cas, on parle d’une perte de NAV qui serait d’environ 3-4% si le collatéral n’est pas très corrélé avec l’indice. Dans le doute, si cela vous inquiète vraiment, suivez régulièrement la solvabilité des contreparties de vos ETF en regardant les notes des agences de notation, la valorisation de leurs CDS et diversifiez-les éventuellement (BNP Paribas, Société Générale etc…).\n\nLes ETF peuvent décider de verser les dividendes ou les coupons des actions ou des obligations qu’ils détiennent, cela est marqué en général par un (D) dans le nom de l’ETF. L’ETF peut alternativement capitaliser les dividendes, c’est-à-dire racheter des paniers avec les dividendes perçus, ce qui a pour avantage de créer des intérêts composés sur le long-terme, ils ont généralement un (C) ou le terme « accumulating » dans le nom. Ce qu’il faut savoir c’est que la plupart des pays retiennent une portion (environ 20-30%) des dividendes qui partent à l’étranger et les rendent uniquement sous certaines conditions. Les ETF ne sont pas capables de les récupérer sauf s’ils sont domiciliés dans le même pays d’où proviennent ces dividendes, on dit donc que ces ETF répliquent les indices en « Net Return ». Pour des résidents fiscaux français, cela veut dire qu’il n’est parfois pas forcément mauvais de privilégier des indices qui pondèrent bien la France et qui sont répliqués par des fonds français (code ISIN commençant par FR), et c’est pour cela que les ETF français sur le CAC 40 sont dits « Gross Return », car ils reçoivent l’intégralité des dividendes.\n\nLe dernier point est la couverture de change (currency hedging). Pour faire simple il s’agît de faire en sorte que les fluctuations des taux de change entre les monnaies dans lesquelles sont cotées les actions de l’indice et la monnaie dans laquelle est coté l’ETF n’influe pas sur la performance du fonds. Si vous êtes un européen qui détient un ETF sur un indice américain et que l’euro gagne de la valeur face au dollar, votre ETF perdra de la performance à cause du taux de change qui s’appliquera sur vos actions américaines qui vaudront moins cher. Inversement, si le dollar gagne de la valeur l’ETF gagnera en performance. Pour éviter cela, les ETF rentrent dans des contrats à taux futur où le taux de change qui s’appliquera lors de la conversion pour la période est spécifié à l’avance. Ils peuvent par exemple prendre un contrat sur 100 millions d’euros d’encours : si la valeur de l’euro augmente, l’ETF sera compensé, mais si l’euro baisse en valeur alors l’ETF devra compenser sa contrepartie, sa NAV ne sera pas affectée par les fluctuations des changes dans tous les cas. Cette méthode n’est pas parfaite car il y a trop de variations d’encours pour couvrir tout l’ETF, en plus cela a un coût sur le très-long-terme. Etant donné que le dollar est une valeur refuge et a tendance à être négativement corrélé avec le marché action en temps de crise, mon conseil personnel est de ne pas trop prendre d’ETF très exposés au dollar qui sont « currency-hedged », peu importe si l’ETF est à réplication physique ou synthétique.\n\n# Les ETF en tant que vecteurs systémiques\n\nUn rapport de l’AMF de 2017 conclue que les ETF en France ont une emprise minime sur le marché (moins de 1% de la capitalisation boursière et des volumes échangés chaque jour). Ils ont aussi montré que le processus de « creation/redemption » avait un effet contracyclique sur les indices. Cela veut dire que les AP ont tendance à effectuer des souscriptions (acheter ou faire acheter de paniers de l’indice) quand les indices perdaient de la valeur et de faire des rachats (vendre des paniers de l’indice) quand les indices en gagnaient. Cela a donc pour effet de diminuer la volatilité des indices sous-jacent, ce qui est positif d’un point de vue systémique.\n\nLa recherche montre que les ETF ont, de façon qui peut sembler contre-intuitive, un impact positif sur l’efficacité des marchés sous-jacents et les mécanismes de découverte de prix. Il existe des méthodes pour estimer quels sont les mouvements de prix en bourse qui correspondent à ceux des investisseurs informés et à ceux qui correspondent à des investisseurs qui font de la spéculation court-terme (noisy investors). Ce qu’ont montré certains chercheurs est que les investisseurs informés, ceux qui investissent un peu avant les gros mouvements des indices, préfèrent initialement acheter ou vendre des parts d’ETF puis ensuite acheter ou vendre des actions individuelles. Ils se servent des ETF pour valoriser les informations qui concernent le marché tout entier et il y a une relation positive entre les encours d’un ETF et la quantité d’informations qu’il apporte au marché grâce à ses investisseurs informés. En retour, cela crée davantage de co-mouvement dans le prix des actions de l’indice, ce qui est une bonne chose dans cas-là. Cependant, ce que montre l’article dont je parle est que si l’arbitrage des AP se fait trop rapidement, ils risquent de ralentir l’arrivée de l’information au reste du marché. L’action contracyclique dont parle l’AMF est justement ce ralentissement de transmission.\n\nIl faut cependant nuancer ce propos. Un ETF sur du small cap ou un ETF sur un indice equal-weighted risque d’avoir une emprise trop forte sur les petites capitalisations et les investisseurs sur ces actions risquent de ne pas pouvoir absorber l’arbitrage des AP. Pour que les ETF aient une influence positive sur les marchés sous-jacents il faut d’abord que ces marchés soient suffisamment liquides et bien suivis par des analystes financiers. Je parlerai plus longuement du risque de liquidité dans le quatrième chapitre, mais il faut le garder à l’esprit. Par ailleurs, je dois souligner que les ETF à effet de levier peuvent quant à eux avoir des effets systémiques négatifs s’ils ont une emprise trop grande sur le marché.\n\nEn dernier lieu, je tiens à souligner que certaines banques centrales se servent d'ETF pour réguler les taux de rendement long-terme et rassurer les participants des marchés secondaires, afin que les entreprises puissent continuer à lever des fonds sur les marchés financiers. Aux US la Fed a lancé un programme d'achat de parts d'ETF obligataires High Yield (dette de mauvaise qualité) pour contourner des restrictions légales dans son mandat. Certains de ces ETF avaient perdu quasiment toute leur valeur suite au choc du Covid-19. Au Japon, la banque centrale achète carrément des ETF d'actions pour soutenir les marchés boursiers, ce qui indirectement aide les épargnants japonais qui ont une grande partie de leur épargne pour la retraite en actions.\n\nCela conclue ce chapitre sur le fonctionnement des marchés financiers, le fonctionnement théorique des ETF et des risques liés aux événements extrêmes (risque de contrepartie/collatéral et risques systémiques). J’espère avoir été suffisamment clair et dans le cas contraire je suis prêt à éclaircir certains passages, voir les réécrire.\n\n# Sources\n\nLES ETF : CARACTERISTIQUES, ETAT DES LIEUX ET ANALYSE DES RISQUES - LE CAS DU MARCHE FRANÇAIS, AMF 2017\n\nPROSPECTUS, AMUNDI ETF SOLUTIONS\n\nDoes ETF trading affect the efficiency of the underlying index?, Liao Xu, Xiangkang Yin 2017\n\nTwo-Sided Markets in Asset Management: Exchange-traded Funds and Securities Lending, Jesse Blocher, Robert E.Whaley 2016\n\nThe counterparty risk exposure of ETF investors, Christophe Hurlin, Grégoire Iseli, Christophe Pérignon, Stanley Yeung 2019"

        "title": "Les ETF en long et en large - Chapitre 1 : Les indices",
        "content": "Bonjour à tous et à toutes.\n\nIl y a quelques temps j'ai fait un post sur les ETF. Il était lourd, pas très précis et au final on n'en sortait pas plus éclairé. Après avoir passé plusieurs mois à lire tout ce qu'il y avait sur les ETF (cours théoriques, articles scientifiques, rapports d'organes régulateurs), leur fonctionnement, leur risque, leur performance et j'en passe et après avoir relu le post récemment, j'aimerais le refaire, cette fois-ci en rassemblant le maximum d'informations que je peux tout en essayant de faire en sorte que ce soit compréhensible pour quelqu'un qui ne connaît pas la finance. **Je pense que c'est important de comprendre dans quoi est-ce que l'on investit et en quoi est-ce que l'on a confiance**. Paradoxalement, ces produits financiers dérivés peuvent être très complexes et sont par la même occasion souvent (pas toujours) le moyen d'investir en bourse avec le meilleur rendement sur le long-terme, compte-tenu du risque et des coûts, **pour un non-initié** (et même pour certains initiés).\n\nJ'ai décidé par suite des conseils avisés de Damien de subdiviser ce répertoire en 5 sections, qui j'espère répondront aux interrogations de la plupart d'entre vous.\n\nChapitre 1 : Les indices\n\nChapitre 2 : Les ETF à réplication physique et synthétique\n\nChapitre 3 : Les ETF obligataires, sur contrats à terme et à effet de levier\n\nChapitre 4 : Les risques - la liquidité, le tracking error, les coûts et comment choisir un ETF\n\nChapitre 5 : Construction d'un portefeuille d'ETF et exemples de stratégies.\n\n# Les indices d’actions boursières\n\nLa logique de départ derrière un indice boursier c'est d'avoir une mesure pour comparer la rentabilité d'actions d'entreprises vis-à-vis du marché boursier auxquelles celles-ci appartiennent, du point de vue d'un investisseur. L'idée est de créer un indicateur de la performance moyenne d'une liste d'entreprises répondant à certains critères (pays, industrie, taille…). Dans l'histoire des marchés financiers il y a eu plusieurs façons de procéder, mais la problématique tournait autour de comment comparer des entreprises qui ont un nombre d'actions différentes à des prix différents sous des formes différentes - une action peut être active ou inactive, cotée ou non cotée.\n\nUne des premières choses qui a été faite était de tout simplement utiliser le prix unitaire de l’action comme référence et utiliser les variations de prix comme un indicateur de la performance. Un tel indice est dit « price-weighted » et il est tout bêtement calculé en faisant la moyenne des prix à l'unité des actions d'une liste d'entreprises, l’exemple le plus connu est le Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Les dividendes passés peuvent être inclus ou exclus du total auquel cas ce serait respectivement un « total return index » ou un « price return index ». Cette technique n’est pas parfaite et nécessite des ajustements réguliers à cause des manipulations que font régulièrement les entreprises cotées. Par exemple, certaines entreprises font ce qu’on appelle des « stock splits » ou des « reverse splits » qui consistent respectivement à multiplier et diviser la quantité d’actions de l’entreprise. Un reverse split où l’entreprise échangerait 2 vieilles actions contre une nouvelle doublerait le prix de l'action de l’entreprise sans créer une quelconque valeur et cela nécessite le réajustement manuel d’un indice price-weighted. Un problème beaucoup plus embêtant est que les prix des actions des entreprises ne sont pas standardisés et si une PME a une action qui coûte 50 euros, une grande entreprise avec une action à 5 euros aura 10 fois moins d’influence sur l’indice.\n\n[Ici Pi\\(t\\) est le prix de la i-ème action de l'indice à l'instant t](https://preview.redd.it/eybwsg4437r41.png?width=136&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d0d223e854516dc725d74e652fd1b589ef9e81)\n\nPour justement contrer ce dernier problème, on a inventé les « equal-weighted indices ». L’idée est d’ajuster le prix des actions de chaque entreprise de l’indice pour qu’elles partent du même niveau et ensuite de procéder comme pour le price-weighting. Par exemple, MSCI, une entreprise qui crée des indices boursiers, réajuste tous les trimestres le prix de base des entreprises inclues dans ses indices equal-weighted. Dans ce genre d’indice, les petites entreprises ont autant d’influence que les grosses. Comme les petites entreprises ont tendance à avoir des prix plus volatiles, ce sont des indices plus risqués.\n\n[Pi\\(0\\) est le prix de la i-ème action de l'indice au dernier ajustement de l'indice](https://preview.redd.it/851aw52o27r41.png?width=131&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fa88056ad3c237d4360889ffe5f552850b367d)\n\nLa méthode la plus généralement acceptée aujourd’hui est d’utiliser la capitalisation boursière des entreprises. La variante spécifique la plus aboutie est le \"free-float\" ou dans son nom complet \"float-adjusted market capitalization weighting\". L'idée derrière ce terme barbare est d'assigner un poids dans l'indice à l'entreprise qui sera proportionnel à **la somme des prix de toutes ses actions actives et échangeables en bourse, les actions en circulation**. Cela permet de suivre la capitalisation boursière, la valorisation des actions qui peuvent théoriquement être achetées ou vendues en bourse à tout moment. Le nombre d’actions cotées peut augmenter soit quand des actionnaires privés (fondateurs, fonds d’investissement) mettent en bourse leurs actions non-cotées ou soit quand l’entreprise en émet de nouvelles actions, dans une vente aux enchères. Ce nombre peut diminuer quand l’entreprise rachète ses actions par exemple pour rémunérer ses actionnaires ou quand l’entreprise émet des obligations convertibles ou des stock-options, qui gèlent des actions pour une période, en attendant qu’elles soient éventuellement appelées par les détenteurs de ces titres si certaines conditions sont remplies à une certaine date. Quand une action sort de la circulation, elle ne reçoit pas, généralement, de dividende ou de droit de vote, ce qui justifie son exclusion.\n\nIl y a deux façons de sélectionner une liste d’entreprises avec cette méthode, soit l’on trie les entreprises par capitalisation boursière et l’on prend les X premières de la liste, soit-l’on choisi une capitalisation minimale et/ou maximale, dans les deux cas la liste d’entreprises peut changer à chaque fois que l’indice est réajusté. Il y a un intérêt théorique à utiliser cette méthode, car plus le marché est efficace, plus un indice créé avec cette méthodologie devrait être proche du portefeuille risqué optimal (avec le meilleur rapport rendement sur volatilité), vu qu'il devrait se rééquilibrer régulièrement en **favorisant les entreprises qui surperforment et en défavorisant celles qui sous-performent**. Le désavantage principal est qu'il surpondère les plus grosses capitalisations.\n\n[Qi représente la quantité d'actions et Fi est la proportion d'actions en circulation, le float](https://preview.redd.it/868xgbly27r41.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=d62eb3a206ef4f632566e6c13533f74a3e0eefb7)\n\nDes exemples notables sont le S&P 500, le Nasdaq, le FTSE 100, le DAX et le CAC 40. Pour l’anecdote, le CAC 40 met une limite de poids de 15% par entreprise. En général, quand un indice contient des entreprises de bourses de différents pays, la monnaie locale n’est pas convertie et la performance est calculée contre la monnaie dans laquelle l’action est cotée, mais il est possible de convertir toutes les valeurs en une monnaie, auquel cas la performance reflète les évolutions du marché des changes.\n\nPour illustrer la différence entre un indice equal-weighted et son équivalent en capitalization-weighted, voici l’indice MSCI World, qui contient 1643 entreprises avec les plus grosses capitalisations boursières des pays développés (et quelques-unes des plus grosses entreprises chinoises).\n\n[Comparaison de l'indice equal-weighted et cap-weighted, l'equal weighted est plus volatile](https://preview.redd.it/vwq8a0li11r41.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=32190c2b591eec03a8a4ad95d74fe481d8d207f7)\n\nDes contraintes spéciales peuvent être placées sur le choix des entreprises à suivre dans un indice. Il faut savoir que la théorie de portefeuille moderne dit que dans un marché efficace où les investisseurs sont rationnels, la volatilité du prix d'une action devrait refléter tous ses risques et que sa rentabilité devrait être proportionnelle à la volatilité et à la corrélation de ses rendements avec le reste du marché boursier (l’indice de référence), ce que l’on mesure avec le bêta. Il s’avère que dans la réalité il existe des exceptions persistantes à cette règle (qu'on appelle anomalies de marché) et que d’autres facteurs que la volatilité et la corrélation au marché peuvent déterminer le rendement d’une action, que certains ont appelé « smart beta » pour vendre l’idée. La théorie classique explique ces anomalies par des inefficacités du marché causées par l’intervention des régulateurs, les coûts de transaction, l’asymétrie de l’information etc… et la théorie comportementale ajoute à ces explications les comportements des investisseurs.\n\nLes anomalies dont on parle sont par exemple l’inertie des prix (momentum), c’est-à-dire que certaines actions ont tendance à poursuivre pendant quelques semaines ou mois des hausses ou des baisses conséquentes de prix. L’explication rationnelle est que les avis des analystes financiers mettent du temps à atteindre tous les investisseurs, l’explication comportementale est que certains investisseurs regardent les performances passées pour déterminer leurs espérances futures. Il y a sinon l’anomalie du « size » et du « value » où, respectivement, des entreprises à faibles capitalisations et avec des bilans relativement importants ont des rendements légèrement supérieurs à la théorie, qui peuvent s’expliquer de façon rationnelle par exemple par le fait que les investisseurs n’aiment pas investir dans des titres peu liquides ou qu’ils n’aiment pas investir dans des entreprises trop endettées. Il existe donc des indices boursiers qui suivent les entreprises les plus sensibles à ces anomalies. Vous trouverez par exemple dans les résumés des indices MSCI la sensibilité des actions de leurs indices à ces anomalies.\n\nMis à part cela, les indices actions dépendent principalement de la croissance des industries et ultimement du PIB des économies sous-jacentes, ils sont une sorte d’estimation des variations futures de celui-ci, bien que d’autres facteurs rentrent en jeu comme les taux d’intérêt et la santé du système financier. Plus le marché boursier où sont échangées les actions de l'indice est efficace (plus les informations sont bien transmises, plus les régulateurs font bien leur travail, plus il y a de liquidité), plus la volatilité de l'indice reflètera les risques sous-jacents et plus le rendement de l'indice sera représentatif des risques pris par les investisseurs sur le très-long-terme. Ainsi, dans des économies croissantes avec des marchés financiers efficaces, les indices boursiers devraient être à tendance haussière car les entreprises sous-jacentes créent de la valeur. Bien que très visibles dans les médias, ils sont bien moins importants en termes de capitalisation boursière que les indices obligataires.\n\n# Les indices obligataires et les autres\n\nLa grosse différence entre une action et une obligation est qu’une obligation a une maturité déterminée à l’avance, alors qu’une action peut exister pour une durée indéterminée. Les Etats et les entreprises peuvent émettre des obligations échangeables dans les bourses obligataires. Ils font des émissions à travers des ventes aux enchères régulièrement, en émettant des obligations avec de diverses maturités, coupons et options. Chaque émission est étudiée séparément par des agences de notation (S&P, Moody’s et Fitch), qui estiment la probabilité de défaut de l’émetteur. En fonction de la note, l’émission est soit catégorisé « Investment Grade » (IG) soit « High Yield / Junk Bond » (HY). Un indice obligataire equal-weighted va traiter chaque émission séparément comme un élément de l’indice avec le même poids que les autres, peu importe le montant de l’émission (avec la formule vue plus haut) alors qu’un indice capitalization-weighted va utiliser le principal (montant notionnel) que doit rembourser l’émetteur comme poids dans l’indice. Comme pour les indices d’actions, les coupons passés peuvent être inclus ou exclus. Certains indices choisissent de sélectionner seulement des obligations avec une maturité spécifique (7-10 ans, 20 ans ou plus…), un type de coupon, une région géographique, un type d’émetteur ou en excluant les obligations avec des options imbriquées par exemple.\n\n[S&P US Aggregate Bond Index, qui rassemblent presque toutes les obligations d'Etat et d'entreprises américaines, IG et HY](https://preview.redd.it/8sum4ppp21r41.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=59c55b2695f14829b68c37ac9f7b40f868fade37)\n\nLes indices obligataires de qualité IG sont typiquement nettement moins volatiles que les indices d’actions. Ces indices réagissent positivement aux baisses des taux d’intérêts (vu que la valeur relative des obligations qu’ils contiennent augmente) et aux éventuels rachats par les banques centrales, le QE, et négativement aux risques de défaut des émetteurs – pour un Etat il s’agit principalement de sa capacité à continuer à emprunter et à lever des impôts, pour une entreprise c’est sa capacité à générer suffisamment de cash (pas forcément des bénéfices) pour payer le principal et les coupons à temps ainsi qu’à liquider ses actifs à bon prix en cas de défaut. Un effet très intéressant des indices obligataires est qu’en mettant ensemble des émissions d’obligation de différentes dates, on peut créer une continuité dans la valorisation des obligations d’un Etat ou d’une entreprise, autrement dit, on transforme quelque chose avec une maturité définie en un indice qui a une maturité indéterminée, un peu comme si c’était une action, ce qui a des conséquences si on cherche à le répliquer.\n\nIl existe des indices de matières premières. Comme celles-ci sont en général encombrantes et coûtent cher à stocker et à transporter, contrairement à des titres financiers qui peuvent être dématérialisés et échangés en une fraction de seconde, elles sont échangées via des contrats où l’on décide plusieurs mois ou années à l’avance la date de la transaction et de la livraison, la quantité etc… Les bourses de commerce rassemblent ces contrats (qu’on appelle futures) et ceux-ci sont échangés de sorte que les investisseurs parient sur l’offre et la demande future des matières premières. Le dernier acheteur du contrat à son expiration a le droit de se faire livrer la matière première, d’annuler le contrat en vendant un autre contrat ou dans certains cas de recevoir la différence entre le prix final du contrat et un prix déterminé par un marché qui négocie la même matière première au comptant. Les indices de matières premières utilisent en général le prix du contrat qui expire à la date la plus proche. Les indices qui rassemblent plusieurs matières premières utilisent soit la valeur notionnelle des contrats échangés sur la matière première, soit la quantité produite dans le monde, soit un equal-weighting. Des exemples notables sont le BCOM ou le S&P GSCI. Ces indices augmentent quand la production diminue et/ou quand la demande augmente et peuvent diminuer quand les frais de stockage et de transport augmentent, par exemple quand il n'y a plus d'espace de stockage disponible.\n\n[S&P GSCI](https://preview.redd.it/b2w52uzw21r41.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96d501ebe89cca147a73905de9bfa09aa2588df)\n\nIl existe aussi des indices sur les options qui mesurent leurs prix et plus spécifiquement leur composante de volatilité implicite. Le VIX mesure le prix moyen des options sur le S&P 500 en enlevant les composants des prix qui correspondent à la direction du prix du sous-jacent et ceux qui correspondent à la valeur temporelle de l’option. Ce prix moyen qu’on a modifié correspond à la volatilité future attendue par les investisseurs sur l’indice, car plus ils payent cher, plus cela veut dire qu’ils veulent couvrir ou spéculer sur de fortes variations.\n\n[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/gccvfx7i21r41.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=a96ee1fc434b81599837454dc8b46b92f05bd785)\n\nCela conclue ce chapitre sur les indices, comment ils sont créés, calculés, ce à quoi ils servent et de quoi ils dépendent. J’espère que cela aura été intéressant."

You are welcome to copy the source and paste an edit if you like and I probably missed a few things or there could be some better consistency. I think some more bold fonts scattered would help and also didn't edit (much) text itself, which may be helpful added with formatting changes in some places. It looks like you're on a good path, but success is a bit of a formula: practice, knowledge, *and* presentation. Just wanted to show how the last part can make a difference.\n***\n\nHello, today we will talk about Applocker bypass techniques in a Windows environment.\n\nPlease upvote and follow if you find this helpful to keep you updated  on new posted. \n\nWhat is Applocker, how does it protect systems, and more importantly, how to bypass this security feature. So many issues to tackle in this article!\n\n***\n\n# What is Applocker?\n\nApplocker is a software whitelisting tool introduced by Microsoft starting from Windows Vista/Seven/2008 in order to restrict standard users to only execute specific applications on the system. e.g.: “Alice can run explorer.exe, Bob, however, cannot!”\n\nIf you are conducting penetration tests, you will likely find Applocker on very sensitive machines: industrial computers, ATM, business workstations, etc.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nTo activate Applocker on your testing machine:\n\n1. Start the Application Identity service (*Administrative Tool -> Services*), \n2. Open the Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc` on a local machine or `gpmc.msc` on a domain controller). \n3. Browse to *Application Control Policies* in *Security Settings*.\n4. Click on *Configure Rule Enforcement* to choose which kind of filtering to perform. As you can see, Applocker covers **five types of applications**:\n\n   a. Regular .exe and .com applications (cmd.exe, ipconfig.exe, etc.)\n\n    b. Windows Installer files (.msi, .msp, .mst), typically used to install a new software on the machine.\n\n    c. Script files with the following extensions .ps1, .vbs, .vba, .cmd and .js.\n\n    d. Packaged Apps installed through the Microsoft Store\n\n    e. DLL files (.dll and .ocx in the advanced tab).\n\nIn this tutorial, we will solely talk about the most commonly deployed restrictions in real world environments that is rules on executables, installers and scripts.\n\nFor each of the five categories mentioned above, we can define rules governing their usage based three criteria:\n\n1. Execution path: e.g. default Applocker rules allow any executable and script present in `C:\\Windows` and `C:\\Program Files` It must do so – at least for some programs – otherwise the system will have trouble booting.\n\n\n2. Publisher information: some executables (Windows binaries for instance) are signed using the vendor’s public key. Applocker can rely on this information to deny/allow executables to run. This feature is rarely used.\n\n3. File hash: Applocker stores MD5 hashes of allowed (or forbidden) files. Every time a program runs, Applocker checks its MD5 and decides accordingly. These rules can consume a good deal of memory, so they are mostly used to forbid some “dangerous” executables.\n\nThis might seem like a lot of knobs to tweak. It is. Configuring Applocker is not for the faint of heart. To make this tutorial most interesting, we will start with a basic configuration and harden it as we improve our hacking skills. Let’s get started!\n\n# Naive Setup\n\nSay an admin sets up the default Applocker rules only: no standard user is allowed to run files (executable, installer or script) outside of the classic `C:\\Windows` and `C:\\Program files` folders. How to run say a `meterpreter.exe` on the machine with a standard account i.e. no admin privileges on the box?\n\nOne way to go is to search for default allowed folders with write access. The idea is to copy the executable into an allowed folder, then launch it from there. Straight forward. Doing it manually can take a bit of time, so how about an automated PowerShell script?\n\nThe execution path restriction also applies to scripts in this case, so we need to be crafty about this. First, we load the script’s content using the `Get-Content` command, convert it to a string then forward it to the Invoke-Expression command which executes it, no questions asked!\n\nOn a default Windows installation, `C:\\Windows\\Tasks` and `C:\\Windows\\tracing` usually pop up as being writable by everyone! Copying our executable (mimikatz.exe, meterpreter.exe, etc.) there for instance bypasses default Applocker lockdown.\n\n*One might argue, quite correctly, that .exe files are over-rated and that we can perform all attacks with native Windows’ most powerful tool PowerShell. That’s very true and by using `Invoke-Expression` we bypass any execution path restriction. Yet, there are some cases when we need to run a simple exe file because it is that simple: a recompiled malware, custom tool, etc.*\n\nIf we can’t find a writable directory allowed in Applocker, we need to resort to other means to run executables. One such method is to load the .exe file in memory, then launch it by jumping to its entry point. No execution path, no Applocker rule triggered!\n\nWe first store the executable, mimikatz.exe in this case, in a PowerShell variable:\n\n`PS > $ByteArray = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(\"C:\\users\\richard\\desktop\\mimikatz.exe\");`\n\nThen use the `Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection` function from the PowerSploit framework to load it in memory and jump to its entry point.\n\n`PS > Invoke-expression(Get-Content .\\Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 |out-string)`\n`PS > Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -PEBytes $ByteArray`\n\nWe can thus effectively bypass any Applocker rule based on Execution paths.\n\n# Tightening the grip\n\nOur savvy admin knows its configuration has a few holes. He tightens the grip a bit further by restricting access to basic Microsoft tools like cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe.\n\nWe cannot use custom scripts (.cmd, .js or .vbs scripts) to execute code because they are only allowed to run from restricted folders (previous rules). But, remember the main issue with blacklists: we always miss something!\n\nIn this case for instance, the admin denied classic Windows 64-bit tools but totally forgot about 32-bit files in the `C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64` folder. To execute PowerShell for instance, we simply run it from that folder.\n\nOnce we have access to a PowerShell prompt we can load executables and scripts in memory and execute them as we saw earlier.\n\nMoreover, performing a search for powershell.exe across the system usually yields other versions of this file may have a different hash from the one banned by Applocker:\n\nSay the admin tracks and blacklists every instance of powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe, cmd.exe… are we done? Not quite. There are other means to execute code on Windows. Remote Procedure Calls for instance provide alternative ways to interacting with the system without using classic command line tools. The utility `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\wmic.exe` can be used to perform such actions.\n\nSure we cannot spawn a PowerShell prompt through WMIC, but it still offers an environment to get interesting information about the system in order to perform a privilege escalation:\n\nYou can find a [complete list of WMI commands](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/17/useful-wmic-queries/)\n\n# Locked down\n\nOur admin grew tired of legit Microsoft tools used in such an evil way so he blocked all the previously mentioned binaries (and some more) to completely lock down the system. No more cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wmic.exe, etc. That seems like a bit of a pickle, but let’s go back to the basics for a second. AppLocker recognizes powershell.exe based on the hash of the file. Which means if we grab a copy of powershell.exe with a different hash, we win! We cannot take an executable (extension .exe) because these files are only allowed to be launched from legitimate windows folders. Never mind, we have other PE type files we can use: **DLL files!** We can find for instance a [DLL implementation of PowerShell](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/17/useful-wmic-queries/).\n\nWe download it to a random folder, then launch it using the `C:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe` utility. To execute a DLL, we give it the name of the DLL and its entry point function, in this case the main function: `rundll32.exe PowerShdll.dll,main`\n\n**Perfect!** We can now run any executable/script we want.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nObviously, the conclusion is to apply protection on DLL files as well as executables. That’s entirely true, however, it requires a lot more work to identify all legitimate DLLs used by business applications on the machine. Not to mention the notable decrease in performance caused by such a systematic check each time any program loads a DLL! We can find ways to thwart DLL whitelisting using the same spirit as the tricks outlined in the above chapters, but that will be the subject of a future article.

So many issues to tackle in this article!\n\nWhat is Applocker?\n\nApplocker is a software whitelisting tool introduced by Microsoft starting from Windows Vista/Seven/2008 in order to restrict standard users to only execute specific applications on the system. e.g.: “Alice can run explorer.exe, Bob, however, cannot!”\n\nIf you are conducting penetration tests, you will likely find Applocker on very sensitive machines: industrial computers, ATM, business workstations, etc.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nTo activate Applocker on your testing machine, start the Application Identity service (Administrative Tool -> Services), then open the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc on a local machine or gpmc.msc on a domain controller). Browse to “Application Control Policies” in “Security Settings”:\n\n￼\n\nClick on “Configure Rule Enforcement” to choose which kind of filtering to perform. As you can see, Applocker covers five types of applications:\n\nThese are regular .exe and .com applications (cmd.exe, ipconfig.exe, etc.)\n\nWindows Installer files (.msi, .msp, .mst), typically used to install a new software on the machine.\n\nScript files with the following extensions .ps1, .vbs, .vba, .cmd and .js.\n\nPackaged Apps installed through the Microsoft Store\n\nDLL files (.dll and .ocx in the advanced tab).\n\nIn this tutorial, we will solely talk about the most commonly deployed restrictions in real world environments that is rules on executables, installers and scripts.\n\nFor each of the five categories mentioned above, we can define rules governing their usage based three criteria:\n\nExecution path: e.g. default Applocker rules allow any executable and script present in “C:\\Windows” and “C:\\Program Files”.
